In a challenging \nyear for the global economy, the bank turned in a solid performance. \nThe global economy faced multiple threats in 2022 \u2013 escalating geopolitical tensions, stubbornly high in \u0235 ation, stalling growth and \nroiling \u0234  nancial markets. \nSupply chain disruptions \u2013 an issue amid the Covid pandemic of the last two years \u2013 were further exacerbated by the Ukraine war. This contributed to rising food, commodities and energy prices. To \u0234 ght decades-high in \u0235 ation, the US Federal \nReserve embarked on its most aggressive monetary tightening since the early 1980s. Altogether, it hiked rates seven times in 2022, raising short-term borrowing costs by 425 basis points to 4.25-4.50%, the highest level in 15 years. Many major central banks around the world similarly followed suit. These moves had a chilling e \u038d ect on equity and bond markets.\nDBS\u2019 key markets Singapore and Hong Kong \u2013 being small, open economies \u2013 were impacted by slowing external demand. Singapore\u2019s economy grew 3.6% in 2022, from 8.9% the year before. Hong Kong\u2019s economy shrank by 3.5%. With its strict zero-Covid policy and property market slump, China remained in the doldrums. Against this backdrop, we had yet another excellent year, with solid \u0234 nancial performance \nand continued delivery against key scorecard goals. DBS also continued to cement its global standing, being named by Global Finance as \"World's Best Bank\". This made it the \u0234 fth \nconsecutive year we had been lauded as the best in the world.\nA banner year \nFor the year, DBS delivered record total income of SGD 16.5 billion. Net pro \u0234 t rose 20% to an \nall-time high of SGD 8.19 billion. Return on equity (ROE), at 15%, was not just a record, but also signi \u0234 cantly higher when compared to \nprevious highs around the 12-13% range.Earnings were propelled by tailwinds from a rising interest rate environment, with net interest margin increasing after three years of decline. Notwithstanding the rise in borrowing costs for corporates and individuals, loans grew 4% in constant-currency terms to SGD 415 billion. Overall, net interest income rose 30% to SGD 10.9 billion. Non-interest income, however, was a drag, declining 3% to SGD 5.56 billion. While card fees increased 20% with travel spending gradually returning to pre-pandemic levels, this was more than o \u038d set by lower wealth \nmanagement and investment banking fees amid the uncertain market environment.

Income \nfrom Treasury Markets normalised from the previous year's exceptional levels to SGD 1.17 billion.Across the franchise, asset quality remained resilient, with the non-performing loan ratio at 1.1%, from 1.3% previously. During the year, we did a range of stress tests under conservative assumptions. These included stress-testing oil at USD 200 a barrel, interest rates at 6-7% for our SME portfolio and a deep recession impacting the cash \u0235 ow of \nour customers by 30%. Across most of these situations, we are con \u0234 dent that asset quality \nis robust. In a turbulent time for the global economy, DBS continued to be recognised for our safety, and liquidity was healthy. Underlining the solidity of our franchise, DBS was named by Global Finance as \"Safest Bank in Asia\" for the 14th consecutive year.\nCementing our Asia franchise \nAs an Asia-centric bank, in the long term, DBS needs to be more deeply embedded in one or more of our four markets outside of Singapore and Hong Kong, which include China, India, Indonesia and Taiwan. In 2022, notwithstanding the China-US trade tensions and China\u2019s zero-Covid policy, DBS continued to make headway in growing its Greater Bay Area (GBA) franchise. Since launching our GBA strategy in 2018, our large-corporate business targeting companies in China\u2019s strategic industries including high-end manufacturing, technology and the new economy, has seen robust growth. Our SME business in the GBA region has also performed well. In the wealth space, DBS Bank (Hong Kong) now provides investment products and solutions to customers from DBS China, Postal Savings Bank of China and Shenzhen Rural Commercial Bank. This makes DBS the only bank with three Southbound Wealth Management Connect partners.Following the amalgamation of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) with DBS India in late 2020, all e\u038d orts have been focused on integrating both \nfranchises smoothly. In 2022, this involved optimising the combined DBS/ LVB branch network, rebranding the LVB branches, and migrating all former LVB customers to DBS technology systems and operating platforms. With our enlarged presence of over 520 branches across 350 locations, 2.5 million retail customers and 15,000 corporate customers, we now have a strong platform from which to accelerate growth. Strategic partnerships including those with Bajaj Finserv to launch our \u0234 rst-ever credit card in India and \nwith ODeX to provide straight-through credit solutions to freight forwarders, continued to scale well. These initiatives helped deliver stronger consumer and SME assets growth, as well as higher income and pro \u0234 tability.\nIn Taiwan, where DBS agreed to acquire Citi's consumer banking business, we are on track to complete and integrate the acquisition by August 2023.

Bangladesh is an attractive investment destination for companies in various sectors, such as power, energy, and transport and logistics. The establishment of DBS Dhaka will provide further impetus to the bank\u2019s activities and enable greater market connectivity to DBS\u2019 customers globally.\nA new way of working\nWhile DBS was ahead of the curve in transforming digitally, we recognise that digitalisation has become table stakes at most banks. However, there are three areas in which we have invested that continue to be di\u038d  erentiating. \nThe \u0234 rst is the industrialisation of arti \u0234 cial \nintelligence (AI)/ machine learning (ML) and data analytics usage across the bank. Our 260 use cases span customer-facing businesses such as consumer and SME banking, and support functions including Legal and Compliance, and Human Resources. For example, DBS sends 45 million hyper-personalised nudges each month to customers across the region with suggestions on how to make their money work harder. In the SME space, AI/ ML is used to provide businesses with early warning signals of potential credit stress. In 2022, the revenue uplift from our AI/ ML initiatives was about SGD 150 million, more than double that from the previous year.The second is our ecosystem strategy, which has allowed us to scale up our business in the large Asian markets without high customer acquisition costs. DBS nearly doubled our ecosystem-led consumer \u0234 nance lending \nin 2022. This was made possible through our partnerships with companies such as ByteDance, Ctrip, Home Credit and Kredivo in markets like China and Indonesia. In institutional banking, we also had good traction in onboarding large platform companies, and through our API suite, \u0234 nancing their extensive supply chains digitally.\nThe third is in the way we manage. While technology is an enabler, companies need to focus on the customer and speed to market to win. This requires a workforce that is agile, nimble, experimental, learning and willing to take risks. A big focus at DBS has been on enabling this internally. Previously, we had programmed change within the organisation such that our employees are trained to put the customer at the heart of all we do. In the past two years, we took this up a notch with the introduction of a new operating model \u201cManaging through Journeys\u201d (MtJs). With MtJ, we re-architected our most important customer processes \u2013 such as those around credit cards, wealth management, consumer \u0234 nance, transactional foreign exchange and \nSMEs \u2013 horizontally. Through the formation of cross-functional squads which are guided by data-driven control towers, we have become more agile in delivering new products, and responding to customer pain points and needs. This has translated to improved customer satisfaction, faster turnaround times and positive revenue impact.\nOur sustainability commitments\nOur conviction has always been that our net-zero commitment, made in October 2021, must be supported by a clear and detailed roadmap and plan. In September 2022, DBS unveiled this plan, which is one of the most comprehensive in scope in the global banking industry. Speci\u0234  cally, we set 2030 interim \ndecarbonisation targets \u2013 that are aligned with science-informed decarbonisation glidepaths \u2013 for seven sectors. These are power, oil and gas, automotive, aviation, shipping, steel and real estate. Data coverage targets were also set for two sectors, food and agribusiness, and chemicals. The nine sectors represent the most carbon-intensive institutional banking segments \u0234 nanced by DBS and constitute \nthe vast majority of the Institutional Banking Group's (IBG's) \u0234 nanced emissions. \nAs part of the implementation roadmap, DBS will proactively partner our customers with advisory and \u0234 nancial solutions to accelerate \ntheir transition to a lower-carbon future. We are con\u0234 dent that many will be willing to come \nalong with us on the journey. This con \u0234 dence \nis borne out by our fast-growing sustainable \u0234 nance book.

These e \u038d orts contributed towards DBS \nachieving carbon neutrality in our operations as at end-2022.On the social agenda, the new Community Impact chapter of DBS Foundation aims to foster a more equitable and inclusive society. A total of SGD 5.6 million was committed towards 10 inaugural programmes across our core markets of Singapore, China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia and Taiwan.One such programme is in partnership with Haqdarshak Empowerment Solutions, which will provide digital and \u0234 nancial literacy \ncourses, and access to social welfare schemes, to 200,000 marginalised individuals in India.For DBS\u2019 commitment to sustainability, the bank was recognised by Global Finance as the global winner for \u201cFinancial Leadership in Sustaining Communities\u201d. DBS was also named to the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index and the FTSE4Good Developed Index for the sixth consecutive year.\nBoard and management changes\nWe would like to express our gratitude to Ho Tian Yee, who is stepping down as a board member in March 2023, for his invaluable contributions. Since joining the DBS Board in 2011, Tian Yee has served in several capacities including as Lead Independent Director and \nDBS is the only bank with three Southbound Wealth Management Connect partners.\n11 Letter from the Chairman & CEO\nChairman of the Nominating Committee. We have bene \u0234 tted greatly from his wisdom \nand insights through the years. Underscoring our deep bench strength, we are pleased that we were able to \u0234 ll two \nCountry Head roles from our slate of internal candidates when the incumbents retired. Veteran banker Ginger Cheng succeeded Neil Ge when he retired as Country CEO of DBS China. A Chinese citizen, Ginger has had a distinguished 20-year career in DBS spanning Hong Kong and China. Under her leadership, DBS\u2019 IBG business in China had grown exponentially, with increased connectivity across the region. Lim Chu Chong, a career DBS banker, took over as President Director of PT Bank DBS Indonesia, succeeding Paulus Sutisna. A seasoned corporate banker, Chu Chong had held various roles in DBS including Regional Head of SME Banking, Head of IBG in China and Chief Operating O \u025d  cer of IBG. Between \n2011 and 2016, he was also non-Independent Commissioner of DBS Indonesia.\nDividends\nGiven the record pro \u0234 t and strong capital base, \nthe Board has proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 42 \ncents per share and a special dividend of 50 cents a share, bringing the full-year dividend to SGD 2.00 per share.

The IMF has projected 2023 global economic growth to be at 2.9%, which would be lower than the 3.4% for 2022. I expect US interest rates to increase to around 5% and stay there in 2023. The latest core Personal Consumption Expenditures price index of more than 4% is still above the Fed\u2019s target. At the same time, job creation in the US remains strong, with the unemployment rate of 3.4% in January 2023, the lowest since 1969.But several green shoots are emerging.First, in\u0235  ation is moderating. Energy prices \nhave declined due to a warmer northern winter and the availability of replacements for Russian oil and gas. At the same time, supply chain constraints have eased signi \u0234 cantly \nas port backlogs are cleared. With interest rates already in restrictive territory, \u0234 nancial \nmarkets have started to price in the end of the rate upcycle. If in \u0235 ation continues to ease \nand a mild recession ensues in the developed economies, we will end up with a soft landing. Second, China\u2019s reopening will provide a substantial boost to economic activity, particularly in Asia. We have seen how other countries\u2019 reopening in the past year created a resurgence in travel and tourism, which are major economic sectors. China is bigger than other countries in the region. I expect consumption to substantially increase and energies unleashed across the region in the coming year now that the short-term pain from China\u2019s reopening appears to have passed.Domestically, China has also corrected course on policies that clamped down on what it saw as excesses in key sectors. In the property sector, it has now provided liquidity support, including for the weakest companies. I do not foresee any property crisis there. In the technology sector, it has allowed major companies to release new games, sign up new customers and carry out new fundraising.Third, geopolitical tensions have started to ease, although spats could occur from time to time. The tone has softened since Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met in Bali in November. China has subsequently appointed its ambassador to the US, who customarily spoke in more measured tones than his wolf warrior foreign ministry colleagues, as foreign minister. High-level exchanges with the US have resumed, with both sides\u2019 foreign and \u0234  nance ministers meeting in recent \nmonths. Relations with Australia have similarly improved with the resumption of senior government exchanges as well as the easing of trade bans, including for coal, a major export.One consequence of these improvements will be the return of animal spirits to \u0234 nancial \nmarkets \u2013 well before their e \u038d ects are felt in \nthe real economy. Since the start of the year, \u0234 nancial assets led by equities and bonds \nglobally have clawed back some of the losses incurred in 2022. I believe Asian markets, having underperformed US markets over the past two years, will lead the upturn.The macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop bodes well for our operating outlook in the coming year. A sustained level of high interest rates is bene \u0234 cial to our established Casa \ndeposit franchise. Our latest net interest margin is now running at more than 2%, which is the highest in more than a decade. The higher rates, together with structural improvements from transformation initiatives, will enable us to sustain a ROE of more than 15% in the foreseeable future. At the same time, the restored con \u0234 dence in \u0234 nancial \nmarkets will lead to a signi \u0234 cant recovery \nin our wealth management fee income, which was the major drag on our performance in 2022. These factors will more than make up for any potential increase in credit costs. Although idiosyncratic risks cannot be ruled out, our ongoing stress tests indicate that asset quality will remain benign in the coming year.\nCan ROE be sustained above 15%?\nOur ROE reached a new high of 17% in the second half of 2022. Higher interest rates were a big tailwind, but the record pro \u0234 tability was \nalso driven by signi \u0234 cant improvements we \nmade to the franchise.If we look back to 2006-2007, when interest rates (and allowance charges) were at similar levels to the second half of 2022, our ROE was 12-13%.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4446, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "48de5d6e-c3a8-4252-80df-2dc2479f94aa": {"__data__": {"id_": "48de5d6e-c3a8-4252-80df-2dc2479f94aa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f73574e-fdad-4c3d-9e22-d31f6777e1e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "de1832c075a27f4786201a68a1a7335bbb9b11700a810fa006bf99310a878729", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ce6cdc4b-1551-4153-b41f-85a62ad79b8d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "a12845a975254e6fb247cdb5863916da2d568430886405236e618341ad3f99b0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "19749a7a-fcdd-4637-b005-25960473c2ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8d07c5d0a532dcc4c269a4e24dff3f3eea150a2babb73788a259ec53406e7304", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "d40b6ab3dd7879c595786fb31a5c764f90e27633c059646b408c9258beb9602e", "text": "These factors will more than make up for any potential increase in credit costs.

Over the past \u0234  ve years, these customers brought \nin more than twice the income on average than non-digital customers. They were also more cost e \u025d  cient to serve.

However, this has little bearing on technology as a continued driver of the global economy. The dot.com crash at the turn of the century testi \u0234 es to that. Between March 2000 \nand October 2002, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell by more than 75%. Twenty years on, more than 60% of the global population are Internet users. Social media is a cultural phenomenon. Mobile and online technology have fundamentally reshaped business models. The fact is that valuations are not necessarily the best indicator of the underlying promise of a technology. Indeed, some technologies we see today have the potential to be truly game-changing.For example, digital technology is here to stay because it has fundamentally altered the way we live, work and play. As for arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/ machine \nlearning (ML), it is already a big part of our lives today. We use conversational AI through our interactions with Siri or Alexa, and AI-powered recommendation engines in our Spotify and Net\u0235 ix selections. With ChatGPT taking the \nworld by storm recently, 2023 is set to be a year of generative AI. Blockchain/ distributed ledger technology allows us to reimagine work \u0235 ows, such as \nthose pertaining to clearing and settlements.

The growing proportion of digital customers enabled operating pro \u0234 t of the consumer and \nSME businesses in these locations to grow at a compounded annual rate of 7% with ROE rising from 23% to 37%.We also extended the digital transformation to other parts of the bank. In private banking, it enabled relationship managers to deliver hyper-personalised services to customers, resulting in more customer transactions. In corporate banking, the integration of our services directly into customers\u2019 supply chains and networks using application programming interface software (or APIs) resulted in higher volumes at lower costs. In Treasury Markets, the full business process \u2013 from distribution to structuring to risk warehousing \u2013 was digitalised, enabling us to handle higher volumes with greater speed.The results are clear. Our assets under management grew at an 8% compounded annual rate since 2017, outpacing the market in Asia. Transaction services fees also increased at an 8% compounded annual rate, while GTS deposits rose almost 40%. Treasury Markets income growth and returns for the past \u0234 ve years surpassed the \nperformance of global peers that we track. Wealth management, transaction services and treasury customer sales \u2013 which are low-capital-usage and high-return businesses \u2013 now make up a greater proportion of income compared to \u0234  ve years ago, resulting in higher \nROE for the group.We have also improved credit processes through the use of data and arti \u0234 cial \nintelligence for underwriting, early warning and portfolio management, which we expect to drive lower cost of credit going forward. In our key growth markets, we are scaling up organically and through acquisitions.The announced increase in quarterly dividend payout to 42 cents per share and special dividend of 50 cents per share are part of our ongoing e \u038d orts to bring our CET1 ratio closer \nto the target and bene \u0234 t ROE.\nTo be sure, there will be a cyclical impact to ROE from changes in interest rates. If interest rates peak in the coming year, part of the ROE improvement so far will come o \u038d , but the \nstructural gains will remain. We expect that as our digital transformation becomes more pervasive, an ROE of 15% is sustainable if interest rates do not return to the unusually low levels seen during most of the past decade. we have to improve productivity,  streamline work processes and o \u038d er \n hyper-personalised insights and nudges  to customers.\u2022 Externally, the bank has sponsored several \n new businesses, such as Partior and  Climate Impact X (CIX). Leveraging  blockchain technology, Partior seeks to  streamline ine \u025d  ciencies in cross-border \n clearing and settlement, while CIX enables  the trading of high-quality carbon credits.  We have also established DBS Digital  Exchange (DDEx) and FIX Marketplace.  DDEx is a bank-backed crypto trading  exchange, while FIX Marketplace is Asia's  \u0234 rst fully digital and automated \u0234 xed \n income execution platform.

Return on equity climbed to 15%, pulling away from previous highs clustered around 12-13%. The results were driven by a 16% increase in total income to SGD 16.5 billion, which passed the SGD 16 billion mark for the \u0234 rst time. \nUnderpinning the growth was a 30% increase in net interest income to SGD 10.9 billion, boosted by a higher net interest margin as interest rates rose, as well as loan growth. Non-interest income was 3% lower than the previous year\u2019s record due to \u0234 nancial market \nvolatility. Lower wealth management and investment banking fees as well as gains on investment securities were o \u038d set by growth \nin other fee income activities and net trading income.The signi \u0234 cant jump in our results re \u0235 ected \nthe pervasive digital transformation we have been making to our franchise for more than a decade. Average interest rates for the year were closer to the years before they were cut to near-zero over the previous two years, enabling the results of the transformation to become more apparent.Our digital transformation has become more entrenched since we \u0234 rst spoke about it in \n2017. For wealth management and retail customers, we have been enhancing our digital platforms and increasingly using data and arti\u0234 cial intelligence to provide them with the \ntools and insights to manage wealth on their own. We have also made it more convenient for them to carry out payments for everyday activities. For corporates, which already use our cash management platforms for collections and payments, we have employed application programming interfaces (APIs) to embed ourselves into customer \u0235 ows and scale up \nsupply chain \u0234 nancing. In Treasury Markets, \ndigitalisation has enabled us to handle higher volumes with faster turnaround times, improve trading e \u025d  ciency and strengthen \nrisk management.The upshot of all this has been even stickier and deeper customer relationships, greater income per customer and lower unit cost of serving them. A few speci \u0234 c outcomes of \nthe transformation were pertinent to the year\u2019s performance. First, by cementing our status as customers\u2019 primary bank, we were able to attract \u2013 and, crucially, retain \u2013 low-cost current and savings account (Casa) deposits. During the period of quantitative easing in 2020-21, our Casa deposits had risen by 60% or SGD 143 billion to SGD 381 billion, a signi \u0234 cantly higher percentage growth \nthan peers despite starting from a much larger base. While Casa deposits did \u0235 ow out in the \nsecond half as expected as interest rates rose, half of the earlier in \u0235 ows did stay with us, and \nwe ended 2022 with Casa deposits of SGD 318 billion. The expanded Casa base enabled us to enjoy higher leverage to rising rates than in prior years, which contributed to the strong total income growth.Second, several fee income activities were structurally larger. Credit and debit card billings rose by double-digit percentage terms for a second consecutive year, reaching new highs as our consumer payments platforms captured the post-pandemic spending recovery. Transaction service fees were propelled by higher domestic and cross-border payment volumes as well as new customer mandates. Compared to 2017, fee income from cards and from transaction services were around 50% bigger. Even wealth management fees, which declined 26% in 2022 due to \u0234 nancial market \nvolatility, remained two- \u0234 fths larger than \u0234 ve \nyears ago. The cumulative \u0234 ve-year growth \nrates of these fee income activities were above peers.Third, the Treasury Markets business delivered both strong growth and higher returns over the past \u0234 ve years. Income from trading and \ncustomer sales was two- \u0234 fths larger than \nin 2017. The digitalisation of our business also meant greater operating leverage as an incremental dollar of income could be generated with lower incremental unit cost. The full-year cost-income ratio improved three percentage points from a year ago to 43%. The second-half underlying ratio was 41%, in line with the longer-term target of around 40% that we had indicated several years ago.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4376, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4060cc20-347c-4224-aa4c-a69e286e9c0d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4060cc20-347c-4224-aa4c-a69e286e9c0d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7586f638-c611-4237-85e5-36a32d24f9de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "f7ee1a45de5d2c4f4b66b0aac492bc7b83dd7004aba3cd57bdaaf8b4dbfe37a4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e608088-eaee-481a-a335-b1593c977c29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "7e5ea8b61c1282adeaf38c8a10505f032b1079521be69026965988002b198e2c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a319b6ca-6c74-4573-adc0-1c642f56de30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ab3ada7a4fdf3bdf98e1b9c8f936a063ea72904178c225645d9ecddc391e92ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "9f3537e400bc87a861ab888c366289ed8f9dc8080f91be6f4bddeef30fffc431", "text": "Even wealth management fees, which declined 26% in 2022 due to \u0234 nancial market \nvolatility, remained two- \u0234 fths larger than \u0234 ve \nyears ago.

We stayed \nvigilant and our portfolios remained resilient and asset quality stable. In 2022, we continued to identify and monitor top and emerging risks across various areas, including (i) credit and portfolio management, (ii) environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, (iii) market and liquidity risks, (iv) new business risks, (v) technology risk, (vi) \u0234 nancial \ncrime risk, (vii) data governance risk, and (viii) cyber security and data protection. Our robust risk management e \u038d orts were \nrecognised when DBS was awarded the \u201cBest Risk Management\u201d award at the 2022 Singapore Corporate Awards.Credit risk and portfolio management\nIn 2022, the Russia-Ukraine con \u0235 ict resulted in \na slowdown of economic growth and increased in\u0235 ationary pressures across the commodities \ncomplex, including oil, gas, and food. Portfolio reviews were conducted in light of these developments. Many sectors, especially for industries with inelastic demand, were able to pass on the higher costs to their customers. While there were no immediate concerns, DBS continued to monitor for potential downstream e \u038d ects.\nAs in\u0235  ationary pressures persisted, central \nbanks began raising interest rates in response. We evaluated our portfolios taking into account the potential impacts of higher interest rates, slower economic growth, and depreciation of multiple currencies against the USD. While the SMEs were assessed to be the most vulnerable, our SME portfolio had been well-tested in previous years and was mostly on a secured basis. Notwithstanding these headwinds, DBS\u2019 overall consumer credit quality remained stable. Residential mortgages, which were primarily in Singapore and Hong Kong, were mainly for owner-occupation and well-secured with low loan-to-value ratios. Unsecured consumer credit loans represented less than 2% of the bank\u2019s total loan exposure.Despite the challenges posed by China\u2019s zero- Covid policy and liquidity issues in the Chinese real estate market, our portfolio remained resilient as our corporate exposure was mainly to top industry players, and consumer exposure was limited. Our Chinese real estate exposures were mainly to larger and investment-grade names, with the remaining exposure generally well-secured. As contagion risks stayed elevated, we remained cautious and closely monitored our exposures.We saw heightened US-China tensions with increasing military activity, trade restrictions, and the US chip ban. While there was no immediate impact to our portfolio, we continued to closely monitor the situation as it evolved.We closely monitored our portfolios in Indonesia and India, which primarily consisted of lending to large corporates, to ensure that there was no deterioration in the portfolio amid rising interest rates and currency depreciation. As headwinds in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment are expected to persist, we will maintain a prudent approach in client selection and credit underwriting criteria to mitigate potential challenges.To improve the quality of our risk management, we also made investments in our internal tools, such as the credit risk data infrastructure and work\u0235  ow management system for our \nInstitutional Banking business. This has brought our relationship and risk managers together on a common platform, allowing us to continue to re\u0234  ne and streamline our end-to-end credit \nprocesses.We also used arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/  \nmachine learning (ML) techniques to enhance our credit underwriting and early warning capabilities for our consumer and SME businesses. This was achieved by training and deploying our credit models, emphasising increasing e \u025d  ciency and speed, \nand incorporating external data from our partnerships. By doing so, we were able to expand our customer base, improve customer experience and increase model predictiveness to drive business success and strengthen risk management.\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) risks \nWe recognise that climate change has risk implications on our portfolio and lending to high-risk sectors will in turn have an impact on the pace of climate change.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4505, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb21e567-dc4f-4730-85fa-3562ba417216": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb21e567-dc4f-4730-85fa-3562ba417216", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5661d3a1-fce2-4663-814b-b7ee18701e83", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "64385db9c02bc1f6850d3e140f86b25251fbffc6a9db9dc42dba3b8faae5f6f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24904856-bad3-4d63-b112-f9da423f78a9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "19", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "c89f5bbba16c24fb75146aa58600226d7c62e99493a738989d7184fb5639338a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a8cfedce-c571-488b-b4b9-afbe02aafb45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f94fcc63b13f060ef9efb26d0b1a1fcc76d1882312c751bbb422530d8924195a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "1fa795e94021bfb16ecb62875cc0b7d87dcfff5ea6e9cf4758efa24a7bf0618b", "text": "This has brought our relationship and risk managers together on a common platform, allowing us to continue to re\u0234  ne and streamline our end-to-end credit \nprocesses.We also used arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI)/  \nmachine learning (ML) techniques to enhance our credit underwriting and early warning capabilities for our consumer and SME businesses.

Our data governance risk into our risk identi \u0234 cation, assessment \nand management therefore continues to be a top priority.In 2022, we incorporated environmental risk into our Risk Appetite Statement, focusing on managing portfolio exposures to material climate transition and physical risks, and decarbonisation strategies. To further strengthen our ESG risk management, we developed (i) quantitative methodologies to assess climate-related transition and physical risks for our Institutional Banking Group lending portfolio, and (ii) a counterparty ESG risk scoring mechanism which forms part of our credit risk management framework.Additionally, we launched comprehensive training programmes with climate risk speci \u0234 c \nmodules to build bank-wide expertise and deepen knowledge in the \u0234 eld.\nRead more about \u201cResponsible \u0234 nancing\u201d in the \nSustainability Report.\nMarket and liquidity risks amidst market volatility\n2022 was a year of heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility. We actively adjusted our market risk exposures and rebalanced hedges during the year. Regular and adhoc stress tests were conducted to evaluate the potential implications to our portfolios in the face of elevated interest rates.As interest rates rose to levels not seen in the past decade, customer funds shifted from our current and savings accounts to \u0234 xed deposits \nand other investments, including government securities. We took measures to maintain our deposit base and continued to do so through active re-pricing and customer engagement. Our liquidity pro \u0234 le remains healthy and well-\ndiversi\u0234  ed, with multiple avenues to access \nfurther wholesale funding whenever necessary.\nNew business risks\nIn January 2022, DBS announced the acquisition of Citi's consumer banking business in Taiwan. The integration process is in progress and is expected to be completed in 2023. We do not anticipate any signi \u0234 cant \nimpact on the consumer banking portfolio with the acquisition.The integration of Lakshmi Vilas Bank has proceeded as expected. To e \u038d ectively manage \nthe risks associated with the new products and expanded network, we have deepened the expertise of our risk management team. We have also strengthened processes for existing products to ensure e \u038d ective management \nover a larger footprint.

We adopted a barbell strategy that spurs innovation and experimentation with new technologies on one end, while keeping a vigilant eye on resilience and risks on the other.\nDriving innovation\nDigitalisation has become table stakes for \u0234 nancial institutions, and many digital \ninitiatives we embarked on over the past few years are now par for the course. To retain our lead and widen the gap between us and our competitors, we must continue creating di\u038d erentiated technology innovations.\nOur arti\u0234  cial intelligence (AI)/ machine learning \n(ML) business use cases increased by seven times to 260, enabling us to achieve about SGD 150 million in revenue in 2022. We aspire to achieve SGD 1 billion in the next \u0234 ve years. Our AI deployments made it possible to deliver tailored customer experiences. About 3 million customers from NAV Planner, our intuitive digital advisory tool, bene \u0234 tted from hyper-\npersonalised nudges. These capabilities are enabled by our in-house designed solutions including ADA, a data analytics platform, ALAN, an award-winning AI knowledge management hub, and our hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure. ADA and ALAN shorten the time required to build and deploy AI models, improving our operations and decision-making.Evolve PavedCloud, our DBS designed public cloud solution, enables public cloud adoption, and allows developers to deploy and manage applications securely and consistently. Public cloud adoption has increased over 17 times in the last four years. CloudOps, a self-service technology marketplace, automates and enhances the e \u025d  ciency of private cloud \noperations, and o \u038d ers platform visualisation.\nEvolve PavedCloud and CloudOps have garnered strong market interest, especially among \u0234 nancial institutions and government \nbodies embarking on their own cloud transformation journeys.FIX Marketplace, Asia\u2019s \u0234 rst digital and \nautomated \u0234 xed-income execution platform, \ndirectly connects issuers with investors. This promotes synergy, democratises capital allocation, and results in cost bene \u0234 ts and time \ne\u025d  ciencies. Over 80 trades, amounting to SGD \n16 billion of issuances in various currencies have been executed.Riding on the successes of our blockchain-based businesses DBS Digital Exchange, Climate Impact X and Partior, we are developing commercial use cases with new \u0234 nancial \nengagement models and distributed ledger technology. Project Orchid, in collaboration with Open Government Products, uses tokenised SGD to facilitate live transactions with selected merchants, while Project Guardian tests the feasibility of Decentralised Finance (DeFi) trading for tokenised securities against tokenised cash. In Project Dunbar, we are exploring a common platform for Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) to enable greater e\u025d  ciency for wholesale cross-border payments.\nWe are continuously exploring metaverse use cases to provide value-added services to our customers. DBS is the \u0234 rst bank in Singapore \nto partner The Sandbox \u2013 one of the largest metaverses on the Ethereum blockchain \u2013 and launch DBS BetterWorld, where we will demonstrate how technology can be used as a force for good.

We also saw large and rapid interest rate rises from rock-bottom rates. Despite this, the Institutional Banking Group (IBG) business executed to strategy and deepened client relationships. It reported solid \u0234  nancial performance, boosted by \nhigher net interest margin, as well as higher loan growth from increased client activities and demand. Through credit vigilance and consistent proactive monitoring of our portfolio, allowances remained low. The digital acceleration at the start of the pandemic in 2020 continued, and our pervasive digital transformation yielded stickier and deeper customer relationships as we embedded our solutions into customer and industry ecosystems.Robust \u0234  nancials despite \nmacro challenges\nIBG's total income rose 28% to a record SGD 7.69 billion.

The ERI industry group saw growth momentum in the renewables sector with investments in energy security and diversi \u0234 cation into \nalternative energy sources driving advisory and \u0234 nancing opportunities. Demonstrating our \nleadership position in the APAC renewables arena, DBS was sole \u0234 nancial advisor to \nTaiya Renewable Energy, in forming a joint venture with EDF Renewables to bid for the development of a 440 megawatt o \u038d shore wind \nfarm in Taiwan. We grew our FI key accounts and participated in their increased deal \u0235 ows in Asia. Revenues \nfrom the FI group grew 45% with deposit income strengthened by new cash application programming interface (API) mandates, as we capitalised on the private capital \u0235 ows to Asia. \nWe continued to execute well across our various key markets. Our business in India saw good momentum as revenues grew 22%.

We bene \u0234 tted from the \ntailwinds that came through higher interest rates, although growth was moderated by market uncertainty which impacted wealth management fee activities. Business momentum was sustained by record-high net new money \u0235 ows into the region and \nthe expansion of our consumer \u0234 nance \nbusiness. We further bolstered our e \u038d orts \nto use arti \u0234 cial intelligence (AI) and machine \nlearning (ML) capabilities to deepen customer engagement, which also yielded good results. We will continue to expand our business footprint and advance our digital solutions to deliver seamless and di \u038d erentiated \ncustomer experiences.\nConsumer Banking/ Wealth Management: Strong interest income growth cushions macro impact \nWe delivered solid earnings, driven by higher interest income. Our total income rose 25% to SGD 6.65 billion, due to substantial net interest margin expansion and growth in loan and deposit volumes. With an improved cost-income ratio, net pro \u0234 t before tax grew 40% to \nSGD 2.69 billion. Net interest income rose 68% to SGD 4.27 billion, driven by Fed rate hikes, stronger deposit earnings, and loan volume growth in most of our markets. This was partially o \u038d set \nby intensifying competition and accelerated re\u0234 nancing of home loans. Nonetheless, \nwe maintained our market share lead in Casa deposits and the mortgage loan space in Singapore. Non-interest income fell 14% to SGD 2.38 billion as investments and bancassurance faced headwinds from market uncertainty. These declines were however o \u038d set by growth \nin card and loan-related fees. Card fees rose 20% to SGD 858 million, as travel spending returned to pre-pandemic levels in most markets. Despite soft consumer demand, the bancassurance business maintained its lead in Singapore for new business market share.Wealth Management: Sustained growth buoyed bynet new money\nOur wealth franchise continued its strong performance, with total wealth management income increasing 20% to SGD 3.27 billion.

We aim to reach \n100,000  Singaporeans and residents across \nvarious community segments, such as youths, persons with disabilities, seniors and hawkers over the next two years. \nToday, some 70,000  students in more than 100  schools are using \nSmart Buddy smartwatches and cards for digital payments. The programme also supports needy students under the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme. To date, about \n60 Smart Buddy schools are \nadministering meal subsidies to some 5,000  students via POSB \nSmart Buddy.\nPOSB PAssion Run for Kids\nSingapore\u2019s largest charity kids run organised a hybrid race, which included a virtual race and onsite sustainability-themed activities. Our beach clean-up and tree planting activity entered the Singapore Book of Records as the Largest Mass Plogging event and raised over \nSGD 930,000 . \nTo date, we have raised SGD 11.6 million , with more than \n790,000  children bene \u0234 tting from 198  programmes. One of the \nmarquee programmes included a \u201cEcoHeroes@Home\u201d programme to encourage children and their families to reduce energy consumption at home.\nFinancial literacy workshops for kids and working adults\nWe partnered community partners, SPED schools and social service agencies to organise \n70 \u0234 nancial literacy workshops \nfor more than 2,600  kids and those with special needs. These \nsessions included bank branch visits to familiarise participants with banking services. Together with the Singapore Stock Exchange and People's Association (PA), we organised over \n13 virtual and physical \nworkshops for more than 3,000  working adults to raise their \nawareness of retirement, estate planning and investment. \nFor seniors\nFor thecommunity", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4586, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c0ea52cb-3f32-4a86-9af4-dd9f04ce6c18": {"__data__": {"id_": "c0ea52cb-3f32-4a86-9af4-dd9f04ce6c18", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "702e1a1a-bfc3-4e01-8e01-9f5c42d63d45", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "f1e52da7945366710e380767c7b63f9ddd360267158dba34b178007b714144f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "655649d9-e3de-42e8-b499-d048fc8e965b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "aafcaf763be9e16aca37260311297b8307687d1d4a84187d3d7824365bcd1ebb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "928b5d41-aa05-4049-aada-9de4c1771985", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "25e11b2564c1bf0a0ca8dde24b90f6fc5f4eb93c4f315b6a5eb4c0491ebb7c2f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a83a6f507c735e65bc7386f38b50d8708edc6ad6ff76445b3c689332d37c1ae1", "text": "42 A Di\u038d  erent Kind of Bank  DBS Annual Report 2022\nGovernance framework\nOur governance framework is anchored on competent leadership, e \u038d ective \ninternal controls, a strong risk culture and accountability to stakeholders.

All Board appointments are based on merit, taking into account the contributions the candidates can bring to the Board to enhance its e \u038d ectiveness. \nUpon the appointment of a new Director, the NC will recommend to the Board his or her appointment to the appropriate Board committee(s) after matching the Director\u2019s skillset to the needs of each Board committee.Induction and Training for DirectorsThe NC oversees the onboarding of new Directors. All new Directors go through our induction programme, which covers theduties and obligations of a Director and the responsibilities of and work carried out by the Board committees. We provide a Director\u2019s pack, which acts as an aide memoire for the information covered bythe induction programme. We have brie \u0234 ng \nsessions for Directors given by members of senior management on the various businesses of DBS and its supporting functions. The NC is also responsible for ensuring that new Directors with no prior experience as a director of a listed company in Singapore undergo training in the roles and responsibilities of a director of a listed company.To equip Directors with the relevant sustainability knowledge, all Directors have completed their mandatory sustainability training in 2022 by attending the sustainability course, \u201cEnvironmental, Social and Governance Essentials\u201d conducted by the Singapore Institute of Directors. Annual review of Directors\u2019 independenceThe NC reviews and determines annually whether each Director is independent in accordance with the stringent standards required of \u0234  nancial institutions prescribed \nunder the Regulations. Under the Regulations, an \u201cindependent director\u201d is de \u0234 ned to mean a \nDirector who is:\u2022  independent from any management and business relationship with DBS;\n\u2022  independent from any substantial shareholder of DBS; and\n\u2022  has not served on the Board of DBS for a continuous period of nine years or longer.\nThe NC assessed and concluded that (i) all Directors are considered to be independent from business relationships with DBS; (ii) with the exception of Mr Piyush Gupta, all Directors are considered to be independent from management relationships with DBS; (iii) with the exception of Mr Chng Kai Fong, all Directors are considered to be independent from DBSH\u2019s substantial shareholder, Temasek Holdings (Private) Limited (Temasek).

Based on the NC\u2019s assessment, the Independent Directors are Dr Bonghan Cho, Ms Punita Lal, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim and Mr Tham Sai Choy.Although Mr Piyush Gupta, Mr Ho Tian Yee, Ms Judy Lee, Mr Olivier Lim, Mr Anthony Lim, Mr Peter Seah and Mr Tham Sai Choy are on the boards of companies that have business relationships with DBS, and are also directors of companies in which Temasek has investments (Temasek portfolio companies), the NC considers these Directors (i) independent of business relationships as the revenues arising from such relationships are not material; and (ii) independent of Temasek as their appointments on the boards of Temasek portfolio companies are non-executive in nature and they are not involved in the day-to-day conduct of the businesses of the Temasek portfolio companies. In addition, none of these Directors sit on any of the boards of the Temasek portfolio companies as a representative of Temasek and they do not take instructions from Temasek in acting as Directors.Board performance and evaluation The NC makes an assessment at least once a year to determine whether the Board and Board committees are performing e \u038d ectively \nand identi\u0234  es steps for improvement. The \nNC believes that it is important to obtain an independent perspective on the Board\u2019s performance periodically, and to gain insights on the Board\u2019s performance against peer boards and best practices. An external evaluator was last engaged to conduct the Board performance evaluation for the \u0234 nancial \nyear ended 2021.In 2022, the NC considered the results and key action items from the 2021 Board evaluation and decided to use substantially the same evaluation questionnaire for 2021 for benchmarking purposes. The questionnaire included questions on Board composition, Board information, Board processes/culture, Board accountability, Capital/ risk, Management, Standards of Conduct, Board relationships and e \u038d ectiveness of Board \ncommittees. Each Director was asked to complete the questionnaire and submit it directly to the Group Secretary who collated the responses and produced a summary report for the NC. The NC analysed the report and submitted its \u0234 ndings to the Board. The \nBoard noted the \u0234 ndings of the evaluation \nand discussed the comments received from several directors.     In addition to the annual Board evaluation exercise, the NC also conducts an annual review of each Director to determine whether each Director remains quali \u0234 ed for o \u025d  ce. \nIn making its determination, the NC will take into account (i) the Director\u2019s age, track record, experience, skills and capabilities; (ii) whether each Director is able to and has been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a Director, including the contributions and performance of each Director; and (iii) whether each Director has committed su \u025d  cient time to \nhis/ her duties as a director of DBS.

The NC assesses each Director\u2019s ability to commit time to DBS\u2019 a \u038d airs in \naccordance with internal guidelines which take into account the number of other board and committee memberships a Director holds, as well as the size and complexity of the companies in which he/ she is a board member. Additionally, each Director is required to complete an annual self- assessment of his/ her time commitments. While the Board has not set a maximum number of listed company board representations a Director may hold, all Directors appreciate the high level of commitment required of a Director. All Directors have met the requirements under the NC\u2019s guidelines. Based on the recent individual Director self-assessment for FY2022, and attendance of Board and Board Committee meetings during the year, the NC was satis \u0234 ed that where a Director had other \nlisted company board representations, and/ or other principal commitments, the Director was able and had been adequately carrying out his/ her duties as a director of DBS.Directors\u2019 tenureThe NC members believe that it is in the interests of DBS for the Board to be comprised of some Directors with long tenure who have a deep understanding of the banking industry, as well as Directors with shorter tenures who can bring fresh ideas and perspectives. There are currently three Directors who have served for more than 11 years, and this is balanced by the progressive refreshing of the Board where six long-serving Directors have stepped down and seven new Directors have been appointed since November 2017 (when we commenced the refreshing process). In addition, one of the long-serving Director (being Mr Ho Tian Yee) will step down after the conclusion of the  2023 AGM.The NC speci \u0234 cally considered the skillsets and \ncontributions of two long-serving Directors who will be remaining on the Board (being Mr Peter Seah and Mr Piyush Gupta). The NC deliberated and agreed that it is in DBS\u2019 interests for these Directors to continue serving on the Board of DBS for the following reasons:i) it is important that Mr Peter Seah remains \nas the Board Chairman to provide leadership and continuity. Mr Seah is a veteran former banker with wide industry experience, and he has been instrumental in the growth and transformation of DBS over the past 13 years. From a strategic perspective, the next few years continue to be critical as DBS continues to execute on its digital transformation, growth and sustainability strategies (especially with the prevailing macro-economic and geo-political headwinds and enhance its franchise in the Greater Bay Area, China, Taiwan, India and Indonesia; and\nii) as CEO, Mr Piyush Gupta should remain \nas a Director to provide the Board with insights into the business.\nRe-election of Directors Under the Constitution of DBSH, one-third of Directors who are longest-serving since their last re-election are required to retire from o\u025d  ce and, if eligible, stand for re-election at \neach AGM. Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years. In addition, new Directors (who are appointed in between AGMs) are required under DBSH\u2019s Constitution to stand for re-election at the \u0234 rst AGM\nafter their appointment. The NC reviews and recommends to the Board the rotation and re- election of Directors at the AGM.Prior to each AGM, Group Secretariat informs the NC which Directors are required to retire at that AGM. The NC will then review the composition of the Board and decide whether to recommend to the Board the re-election of these Directors, after taking into account factors such as their attendance, participation, contribution, expertise and competing time commitments.At the 2023 AGM, Mr Peter Seah, Mr Ho Tian Yee, Ms Punita Lal and Mr Anthony Lim will be retiring by rotation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4130, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dd2aa2b9-28d5-4228-ab5c-6a61348c221a": {"__data__": {"id_": "dd2aa2b9-28d5-4228-ab5c-6a61348c221a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b178a90f-ffdf-4a4b-b483-ef29cb149603", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "a2c3a6396842336d54e4da42d1905536dbafd8898b42a954f170382f332d192b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a5de6ba-3564-46e8-999c-3b1fb52e5e73", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "6147efc18eb61ccc37302d36a8b1b64b0b74a595dfa9b45957d672416f9f6f23", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fa2069d5-7637-4111-b8ce-a55d4da93949", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eee374be29ceae1228222f2d7c29e0012af314a57481b1b12e318a75818f3003", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "a175efcbdc72f3454c4280c0bed1e1fe6998720f976cd00d33adda5a353678f1", "text": "Based on this rotation process, each Director is required to submit himself or herself for re-election by shareholders at least once every three years.

The NC selects topics which are relevant to the Group\u2019s activities. Board members also contribute by highlighting areas of interests and possible topics.The topics presented to the Board in 2022 as part of the continuous development programme included: (i) training sessions on DBS\u2019 country risk management and fundamental review of the trading book, (ii) insights from external experts on (a) climate risk management, as well as (b) managing ransomware and supply chain cyber risks from the regulators\u2019 perspective.    Board diversity We recognise that diversity is not merely limited to gender or any other personal attributes. We adopted a Board Diversity Policy which recognises the importance of having an e\u038d ective and diverse Board, and states that \nthe NC is responsible for setting the relevant objectives that promote and achieve diversity on the Board. In discharging its duties, the NC shall give due regard to the bene \u0234 ts of all \naspects of diversity and strive to ensure that the Board is appropriately balanced to support the long-term success of DBS.The main objective of the Board Diversity Policy is to continue to maintain the appropriate balance of perspectives, skills and experience on the Board to support the long-term success of DBS. The Board Diversity Policy provides that the NC shall endeavour to ensure that female candidates are included for consideration when identifying candidates to be appointed as new directors, with the aim of having not less than two female directors on the Board, and will target to achieve 30% female Board representation by 2030. Currently, two out of 10 directors on the Board (20% of the Board) are female. The NC is responsible for developing a framework to identify the skills that the Board collectively needs in order to discharge the Board\u2019s responsibilities e \u038d ectively, taking \ninto account the complexity of DBS\u2019 existing risk pro\u0234  le, business operations and future \nbusiness strategy. The NC has put in place a skills matrix which classi \u0234 es skills, experience \nand knowledge of Directors into the following broad categories (i) Industry knowledge and experience; (ii) Financial and commercial acumen; (iii) Governance; (iv) Leadership; (v) Digital Transformation; and (vi) Sustainability.\n53 Corporate governance\nThe NC believes that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional quali\u0234  cations, age and gender on the Board, \nand is satis \u0234 ed that the objectives of the Board \nDiversity Policy continue to be met.\nBoard Executive Committee (EXCO)\u201cIn 2022, the Board EXCO continued to serve as a sounding board to Management on signi\u03ad  cant issues, including potential \nacquisitions and divestments, large transactions and material initiatives, and large credit and country limit reviews in markets that the Group has a presence in.\u201dPeter Seah Chairman, Board EXCO\nHighlights of EXCO\u2019s activities in 2022\u2022  The EXCO assists the Board to enhance the business strategies and strengthen core competencies of DBS.", "start_char_idx": 3234, "end_char_idx": 8024, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa2069d5-7637-4111-b8ce-a55d4da93949": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa2069d5-7637-4111-b8ce-a55d4da93949", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b178a90f-ffdf-4a4b-b483-ef29cb149603", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "a2c3a6396842336d54e4da42d1905536dbafd8898b42a954f170382f332d192b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "dd2aa2b9-28d5-4228-ab5c-6a61348c221a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "29", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "a175efcbdc72f3454c4280c0bed1e1fe6998720f976cd00d33adda5a353678f1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d469c485-33dd-4cb7-adff-699086b18146", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "fb41225dd66cbbc3929dc5076ab34112f9b7fb49fa637cf289dbbdc2a72cdb1b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "eee374be29ceae1228222f2d7c29e0012af314a57481b1b12e318a75818f3003", "text": "53 Corporate governance\nThe NC believes that there is an appropriate balance of industry knowledge, skills, background, experience, professional quali\u0234  cations, age and gender on the Board, \nand is satis \u0234 ed that the objectives of the Board \nDiversity Policy continue to be met.\nBoard Executive Committee (EXCO)\u201cIn 2022, the Board EXCO continued to serve as a sounding board to Management on signi\u03ad  cant issues, including potential \nacquisitions and divestments, large transactions and material initiatives, and large credit and country limit reviews in markets that the Group has a presence in.\u201dPeter Seah Chairman, Board EXCO\nHighlights of EXCO\u2019s activities in 2022\u2022  The EXCO assists the Board to enhance the business strategies and strengthen core competencies of DBS.

The trading \nupdates, which comprise the pro \u0234 t and loss \naccount, key balance sheet items, \u0234 nancial \nratios and business commentary, are intended to provide investors with continued line of sight on the Group\u2019s ongoing performance.The AC reviewed the Group\u2019s trading updates and half-yearly \u0234 nancial statements, and \nrecommended these to the Board for approval.

The Chair of the AC meets the Head of Group Audit regularly to discuss the audit plans, current work, key \u0234 ndings and other \nsigni\u0234 cant matters of Group Audit regularly \nto discuss the audit plans, current work, key \u0234 ndings and other signi \u0234 cant matters.Reviewing performance, objectivity and independence of the external auditorThe AC has unfettered access to the external auditor. Separate sessions were held during each of the four quarterly AC meetings in 2022 for the AC to meet with the external auditor without the presence of management to discuss matters that might have to be raised privately. The planned transition of the PwC partner in charge of the audit from Antony Eldridge to Yura Mahindroo was smooth.The AC monitors the performance, objectivity and independence of the external auditor. For this purpose, the AC takes into account the Audit Quality Indicators Disclosure Framework issued by the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA); the guidance provided in Practice Guidance 10 of the 2018 Code, as well as the principles outlined by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in its document \u201cThe External Audits of Banks\u201d. Signi\u0234 cant matters How the AC reviewed these matters\nSpeci\u0234 c allowances \nfor loans and advancesThe AC reviewed the signi \u0234 cant non-performing credit exposures periodically and considered management\u2019s \njudgments, assumptions and methodologies used in the determination of the level of speci \u0234 c allowances required. \nThe AC noted that major weak credits are reviewed by the Board Executive Committee quarterly and presented to the AC. The AC was apprised of the external auditor\u2019s work over credit, which included sampling across performing, watch-list and non-performing portfolios to assess the appropriateness of the loan ratings and classi \u0234 cation, as well \nas the adequacy of speci \u0234 c allowances where applicable. Additionally, the AC considered the results from Group \nAudit\u2019s independent assessment of the Group\u2019s credit portfolios across key markets and credit risk management process. The AC is of the view that the speci \u0234 c allowances that have been set aside for non-performing credit \nexposures are appropriate.\nGeneral allowances for credit lossesThe AC reviewed the governance arrangements, including the matters considered by the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) Review Committee, as well as the key drivers of the quarterly movements in Stage 1 and Stage 2 ECL (General Allowances). These included the changes in portfolio asset quality, prevailing economic and geopolitical conditions, as well as modelled overlays to re \u0235 ect management\u2019s assessment of these factors. The AC noted that ECL models \nare validated by the Model Validation Team, which also monitors the models\u2019 performance, and approved by the Group Credit Risk Models Committee.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4667, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "77379617-8690-422d-9628-cdad04936c92": {"__data__": {"id_": "77379617-8690-422d-9628-cdad04936c92", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27bda10b-824e-45f7-b89a-13609ef4c73a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "5435ed8d142fc497c5fe3a80434898df494dad45c61baeca1d2cc85281267d02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "15c48196-f21b-4f5c-a513-62d1da578ec8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "68afc2159d64890d324976703100e15cfd6c10a3eb92adc10e663388b7a6d34a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b66c0cbd-5ffd-471c-8668-a13a009d5199", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8323e4679196ba09034b4d0f12c3e5bc72dda955dba2736c0750d88abbc67285", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fa9a8a9259a2e5a9dcc9744ec7ba8b5b91c6d7f186fcca47f5e593148ef0979f", "text": "Additionally, the AC considered the results from Group \nAudit\u2019s independent assessment of the Group\u2019s credit portfolios across key markets and credit risk management process.

The BRMC monitored global political and economic events, the impact of interest rate hikes, and other factors that might have material consequences for our business.In 2022, the BRMC discussed the \u0234 ndings and \nthe impact arising from scenario analyses and portfolio reviews conducted on certain countries and speci \u0234 c sectors, including:\n\u2022  In\u0235 ationary pressures prompting signi \u0234 cant \nrate hikes by central banks resulting in slower economic growth/ recession \n\u2022  Russia-Ukraine con \u0235 ict and the impact on \nsupply chain, commodity/ energy prices and key exports from the two countries   \n\u2022  Defaults of major Chinese real estate developers triggering a property sector downturn in China and other contagion e\u038d ect\nThe scenario analyses are in addition to the reviews of various regulatory and internal stress testing exercises.The BRMC also reviewed management\u2019s assessment of the impact arising from the following events:\u2022  Elevated US-China-Taiwan tensions, in particular, areas such as capital market restrictions, export bans and trade tari \u038d s\n\u2022  Slowdown in China\u2019s economy, including weak domestic consumption and RMB depreciation \n\u2022  Strong USD against the developing/emerging markets currencies (e.g., INRand IDR).\nThe BRMC was updated on the liquidity risk pro\u0234  le and discussed the impact of \ncustomer funds switching out from current/savings accounts to \u0234 xed deposits. It was kept \ninformed of the utilisation of market risk (for both banking and trading books) and liquidity risk (in all major currencies and legal entities) limits, as well as the key operational risk pro\u0234 les of the Group.  \nThe BRMC endorsed the incorporation of environmental risk in the Group\u2019s risk appetite statement, with a focus on managing exposures with material climate transition and physical risks. The BRMC was updated on the risk and controls of new businesses (e.g., Digital Asset Ecosystem) as well as the integration progress of LVB and Citi's Taiwan consumer banking business. It was also regularly updated on the initiatives to improve our technology resiliency in the course of 2022.The BRMC was advised on the key operational risk pro \u0234 les of the Group and the \ncontinued focus on global trends on \u0234 nancial \ncrime (such as anti-money laundering, countering the \u0234 nancing of terrorism, and \ndigital scams), fair dealing and conduct risks as well as the cyber security environment. In view of the worsening geopolitical tensions, the BRMC was updated on the increased e\u038d orts taken to address the risks arising from \nsanctions evasion and cyber security.The BRMC reviewed and approved the risk models governance framework, which covers the development, approval and ongoing performance monitoring.

Talent Review and Succession Planning The CMDC reviews the state of talent and the strength of the human capital in DBS in support of its business. This includes a review of the business strategy of the business, the target operating model, and talent bench strength required to drive our business outcomes. b \nThe CMDC also reviews the succession plans for CEO and GMC members. Succession Planning is a rigorous process in DBS which includes inputs from the respective Country and Group Functional Heads, followed by detailed reviews with the CEO. The CMDC evaluates the succession plans of CEO and the GMC members based on DBS\u2019 proprietary \u201cKey Success Factors\u201d framework, which comprises four dimensions of a DBS senior leader success pro \u0234 le: (i) domain knowledge, \n(ii) critical experiences, (iii) leadership competencies and (iv) leadership traits. Potential successors for GMC are evaluated against these four dimensions to assess their readiness, and development plans to address their leadership gaps are put in place to prepare them for succession. b \nIn reviewing our talent bench strength, the CMDC evaluates how our High Potentials (HIPOs) have been identi \u0234 ed, developed, \ncompensated and progressed in their career with the Bank. We follow a robust HIPO identi\u0234  cation process based on the \n\u201c3P framework\u201d, namely Performance, PRIDE! and Potential. The assessment of potential is based on one\u2019s ability, aspiration and engagement. Identi \u0234 ed HIPOs are \ndeveloped through a comprehensive \u201cTriple-E Development Framework\u201d which focuses on actionable development activities around education (conferences and leadership programs), exposure (mentoring, coaching and networking) and experience (new or stretched 57 Corporate governance\nroles, cross country and cross function assignments), all designed to accelerate their growth and groom them for potential succession to key leadership roles in the future.b This disciplined process ensures that \nthe Bank builds a robust succession pipeline deeper down the organisation for resilience. b \nLearning and Leadership DBS places heavy investment in the development of our people as guided by our Triple-E Development Framework. Areas of learning focus are determined by reviewing market trends and relevant skills needed to drive our business. Campaigns are launched to promote a strong learning culture, and the introduction of bite-sized e-learning modules promotes accessibility to learning for our employees. We have seen an increase in learning consumption during the pandemic years. In 2022, we launched an AI-powered personalised career companion (iGrow) to help every DBS employee identify future career aspirations, skills required to reach these goals and provide relevant learning and role exposure opportunities.The CMDC is kept apprised on our year-on-year learning metrics including average learning places per employee, average learning hours per employee and training expenses as a percentage of budget. It also reviews how we ensure our employees receive learning in relevant skills for the business.   In 2022, 35,943 active employees (99.6% of total headcount) have undergone training and the average learning places per employee was 40.5. We also identi \u0234 ed 8,339 employees \nfor upskilling and reskilling, of which 87.3% have completed or are in-progress with their learning roadmaps. Our DBS Transformational Leadership Plan continues to gain traction. Through our internally-designed and facilitated leadership workshops such as our T-Sprints and T-Circles, and also our signature leadership development programmes such as Building Great Managers and Making Great Decisions, we work to embed our DBS Transformational Leadership attributes into our leaders and our leadership teams. Our average Manager E\u038d ectiveness score has improved to 91%.\nRecruitmentThe CMDC reviews the recruitment trends, such as the year-on-year hiring numbers, job families or roles which the Bank hires for. In 2022, we experienced a surge in hiring, mainly into technology and revenuegenerating roles. In 2023, we expect the hiring pace to slow down in line with the macro environment. The CMDC also reviews the e \u025d  cacy of our \nrecruitment strategy including how sourcing is done through various channels such as campus recruitment, career sites, social media, internal mobility, sta \u038d  referrals etc, and how \ncandidates are assessed and selected using a combination of tools including AI, assessments tests and interviews.", "start_char_idx": 3682, "end_char_idx": 8293, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "80994fdd-e305-4252-b587-7530cbfb8421": {"__data__": {"id_": "80994fdd-e305-4252-b587-7530cbfb8421", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "49a14452-5484-49dc-b148-4db37fe13b1e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "0234a4768b696929fd711bf32b7b8d86628ffcee7850cf1feef43fc6963ef128", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e1832ffd-385a-42f6-a841-58428577e23e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "5891685e438e89064065f16354bb1c3211c41cc3cdf7b35cdf98dc049bc5dbb8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "487d6be0-0ed7-4de2-b642-804fc152e0e0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "26fae2cad8c464411244e583fd457e208edd320d88545342d11bdb55e34595d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "7626ca7fe83fe3de15b6d96b69c745d2e229a7c8031406bf6abd01a99cf17eba", "text": "Our average Manager E\u038d ectiveness score has improved to 91%.\nRecruitmentThe CMDC reviews the recruitment trends, such as the year-on-year hiring numbers, job families or roles which the Bank hires for.

The remuneration of non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, has been benchmarked against global and local \u0234 nancial \ninstitutions. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, non-executive Directors receive 70% of their fees in cash and the remaining 30% in share awards.The share awards are not subject to a vesting period, but are subject to a selling moratorium whereby each non-executive Director is required to hold the equivalent of one year\u2019s basic retainer fees for his or her tenure as a Director and for one year after the date he or she steps down. The fair value of share grants to the non-executive Directors are based on the volume-weighted average price of the ordinary shares of DBSH over the 10 trading days immediately prior to (and excluding)the date of the AGM. The actual number of ordinary shares to be awarded are rounded down to the nearest share, and any residual balance is paid in cash. Other than these share awards, the non-executive Directors do not receive any other share incentives or securities under the DBSH Share Plan.The table on page 56 sets out the annual fee structure for the non-executive Directors for FY2022. There is no change to the annual fee structure from FY2021. Non-executive Directors are also paid attendance fees for attending Board and Board committee meetings. Shareholders are entitled to vote on the remuneration of non-executive Directors at the 2023 AGM.Although the non-executive Directors\u2019 fee structure for FY2022 remains unchanged from the previous year, the amount of non-executive Directors\u2019 remuneration for FY2022 is approximately 8.2% higher than that for FY2021. The higher remuneration for FY2022 is mainly attributable to the following reasons: (i) Higher attendance fees due to the increased number of physical meetings in 2022 (as opposed to virtual); (ii) the establishment of the BSC; and (iii) an increase in the number of AC members.In addition, Mr Peter Seah (who is also the Chairman of DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited) received director\u2019s fees of HKD 1,096,000 for FY2022, and Mr Tham Sai Choy (who sits on the board of DBS Bank (China) Limited) received director\u2019s fees of CNY 540,000 in FY2022.None of the Group\u2019s employees was an immediate family member of a Director with remuneration exceeding SGD 100,000 in 2022.\nBoard Sustainability Committee (BSC)\u201cIn 2022, we established the BSC to build on our sustainability agenda and net-zero commitment. This underscores the growing importance of sustainability as a strategic imperative for us and the additional Board-level oversight it warrants. The BSC provides additional governance and oversight of material ESG matters in respect of our three sustainability pillars, including climate-related matters and our annual sustainability disclosures. We also welcomed Dr Ben Caldecott to the BSC in June 2022, where his expertise in sustainable \u03ad  nance is a valuable asset to \nthe BSC and the Group.The BSC will continue to oversee the complex and extensive work done in driving the transition to net zero, as we further weave ESG into the fabric of our business in 2023.\u201dPiyush Gupta, Chairman, BSC", "start_char_idx": 7572, "end_char_idx": 11962, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "487d6be0-0ed7-4de2-b642-804fc152e0e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "487d6be0-0ed7-4de2-b642-804fc152e0e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6866be76-1416-4afd-acb7-fd39e3570337", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "0db71f12634973ac6ca833943ed5418e1e99f1566c5eeb446c59f7594456251a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80994fdd-e305-4252-b587-7530cbfb8421", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "7626ca7fe83fe3de15b6d96b69c745d2e229a7c8031406bf6abd01a99cf17eba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0775c280-543d-43af-9752-8c704d0ea82e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0258801b1a54f4092e712fddd333f87d35d584764b0efa9377dcb4812eb2f29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "26fae2cad8c464411244e583fd457e208edd320d88545342d11bdb55e34595d6", "text": "58 A Di\u038d  erent Kind of Bank  DBS Annual Report 2022\nHighlights of BSC\u2019s activities in 2022Appointment of Dr Ben CaldecottThe BSC has bene \u0234 ted from the appointment \nof Dr Caldecott as a non-Director member of the BSC in June 2022.

At the University of Oxford, he is the inaugural Lombard Odier Associate Professor of Sustainable Finance, the \u0234 rst ever \nendowed professorship of sustainable \u0234 nance. \nIn addition, he serves on the Adaptation Committee of the UK Climate Change Committee and is co-head of the Transition Plan Taskforce established by HM Treasury in 2022 to advise on net zero transition plans. Oversight of sustainability reporting and climate-related disclosure matters In response to tracking our disclosures following our public commitment to join the Net Zero Banking Alliance, the BSC reviewed and approved the publication of a set of targets for our Scope 3 \u0234 nanced emissions \nthat will guide us on strategically channeling \u0234 nancing away from high-emitting activities \ntowards low-carbon alternatives.  In addition, in order to elevate our commitments and enhance our disclosures on the social agenda, the BSC reviewed and approved the publication of policies relating to human rights and diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as enhanced disclosures related to our approach to human rights due diligence. Oversight of Group Sustainability CouncilThe BSC has direct oversight of the Group Sustainability Council, which is chaired by the Chief Sustainability O \u025d  cer and comprises \nsenior members from key business and support units across DBS.

Announcement of Decarbonisation Commitments As part of DBS\u2019 commitment to being net zero in its \u0234 nanced emissions by 2050, the \nBSC was actively involved in reviewing and approving a report setting out sectoral targets for nine sectors, and aligned with science-based decarbonisation glidepaths. This report was announced in September 2022. The BSC will review the targets periodically and any updates on DBS\u2019 progress will be provided annually in the Sustainability Report.\nPlease refer to the Governance chapter in the Sustainability Report 2022 for more details on the sustainability-related governance structure.\nE\u038d ective controls\nGroup Approving AuthorityThe Group Approving Authority (GAA) is an integral part of our corporate governance framework and was updated in August 2022.The Board\u2019s responsibilities are well de \u0234 ned \nin the GAA.

The respective heads of audit in each of the \u0234 ve key locations \noutside Singapore are part of that location\u2019s management team.Group Audit adopts a risk-based approach in its auditing activities. An annual audit plan is developed using a structured risk and control assessment framework through which the inherent risk and control e \u038d ectiveness of each \nauditable entity in the Group are assessed. This risk assessment methodology and approach are aligned with that of the Group, including the risk taxonomy.The assessment also covers risks arising from new lines of business, new products and emerging risks from DBS\u2019 operating environment. Audit projects are planned based on the results of the assessment, with priority given to auditing higher risk areas and as required by regulators.Audit reports containing identi \u0234 ed issues \nand corrective action plans are reported to the AC and senior management. Progress of the corrective action plans is monitored, and past due action plans are included in regular reports to the senior management and the AC. In all routine audits, Group Audit evaluates the control environment and management\u2019s control awareness which incorporates risk culture as guided by the Financial Stability Board\u2019s Guidance on Sound Risk Culture.Group Audit apprises regulators and external auditors of all relevant audit matters. It works closely with external auditors to coordinate audit e\u038d  orts.\nQuality assurance and key developmentsIn line with leading practices, Group Audit has a quality assurance and improvement programme (QAIP) that covers its audit activity and conforms to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing. As part of the QAIP, internal quality assurance reviews (QAR) are conducted quarterly and external QAR are carried out at least once every \u0234 ve years by quali \u0234 ed professionals from an \nexternal organisation. From 2019 to 2021, the internal QAR was contracted to an independent assessor, Protiviti. Based on Protiviti\u2019s assessment, Group Audit leads the industry in the use of Agile Auditing approach and digital audit tools. These tools incorporate both rule-based and predictive analytics, enabling continuous risk monitoring. For 2021, in Protiviti\u2019s capability maturity model, Group Audit was rated the highest level for Reporting in addition to audit planning, agile auditing, dynamic risk assessment, and data analytics. For independence, bobjectivity \nand transparency, Group Audit appointed Ernst & Young in 2022 as the new independent assessor for the internal QAR.In 2022, Group Audit implemented Audit Xchange, a workbench to institutionalise and digitise its Data Driven Operating Model and Agile practices to improve its audit process. We also enhanced on our dynamic risk assessment and continuous monitoring capabilities to improve the speed of risk identi\u0234  cation and response. The increased use \nof analytical tools and data driven approach, coupled with DBS\u2019 suite of remote working technologies, has helped Group Audit to be more e\u038d ective in providing audit assurance.\nDealings in securities  Although the Group has transitioned to a semi-annual reporting regime, the trading updates that are provided for the \u0234 rst and \nthird quarters of each \u0234 nancial year are, \nfor the purpose of the \u201cblack-out\u201d policies prescribed under Rule 1207(19) of the SGX Listing Rules, deemed to constitute \u201c \u0234 nancial \nstatements\u201d.

Such employees are also required to seek pre- clearance before making any personal trades in securities, and may only trade through the Group\u2019s stockbroking subsidiaries and bank channels for securities listed in Singapore and Hong Kong. The personal investment policy discourages employees from engaging in short- term speculative trading.Related Party Transactions and Interested Person TransactionsDBS has embedded procedures to comply with regulations governing related party transactions and interested party transactions. For related party transactions, we are required to comply with regulations prescribed by the MAS which set out the de \u0234 nition, scope and \ngeneral principles governing such transactions, along with the responsibilities of banks to maintain oversight and control so as to mitigate the risk of abuse arising from con \u0235 icts \nof interest. We have established a Board-approved framework to give e \u038d ect to these regulatory \nrequirements. This, along with material related party transactions, is reviewed by the Board regularly. All new Directors are briefed on relevant  provisions that a \u038d ect them. If necessary, \nexisting credit facilities to related parties are adjusted prior to a Director\u2019s appointment, and all credit facilities to related parties are continually monitored. With respect to interested party transactions, we have established processes to comply with the requirements outlined in Chapter 9 of the SGX-ST Listing Manual. The aggregate contract values of DBS\u2019 interested person transactions entered into in 2022 are set out in the table on page 60. DBS entered into various interested person transactions with Temasek and its associates on arm\u2019s length commercial terms and for the purpose of carrying out day-to-day operations (such as leasing of premises, telecommunication/ data services, IT systems and related services, redemption of air miles by DBS/ POSB credit card holders, logistics and security services).In FY2022, our contracts with Temasek  Holdings (Private) Limited Group amounted to an aggregated SGD 79.0 million. This  accounted for less than 0.15% of DBS\u2019 audited  net tangible assets.Material contractsSave for the transactions disclosed in the table on page 60 and via SGXNET, there were no material contracts involving the interest of any Director or controlling shareholder of DBS entered into by DBS or any of its subsidiary companies, which are either still subsisting at the end of the \u0234 nancial year, or if not then \nsubsisting, entered into since the end of the previous \u0234  nancial year.\nAssessing the e\u038d  ectiveness of internal \ncontrolsDBS has a risk management process that requires all units to perform a half-yearly risk and control self-assessment (RCSA) to assess the e\u038d ectiveness of their internal controls. In \naddition, all units of the Group are required to submit quarterly attestations on their controls relating to the \u0234 nancial reporting process, and \nannual attestations on their compliance with the overall internal controls framework. Based on the RCSA and the quarterly and annual attestations, the CEO and the key management personnel responsible for risk management and internal control systems provide an annual attestation to the AC relating to the adequacy and e\u038d ectiveness of DBS\u2019 risk management \nand internal control systems.Group Audit performs regular independent reviews to provide assurance on the adequacy and e \u038d ectiveness of DBS\u2019 internal \ncontrols on risk management, control and governance processes. The overall adequacy and e\u038d ectiveness of DBS\u2019 internal controls \nframework is reviewed by the AC and BRMC.Rule 720(1) UndertakingIn compliance with Rule 720(1) of the Listing Manual, we have procured undertakings from all of our Directors and executive o \u025d  cers to \nuse their best endeavours to (a) comply with the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual; and (b) procure that DBS complies with the relevant provisions of the Listing Manual. \n1.

In particular, but without limiting the foregoing, the Board noted that: (i) in relation to the two-day digital disruption  in November 2021 in Singapore,    management has completed the remedial  plans arising from an external  independent review. Initiatives to  strengthen DBS\u2019 technology resilience will  continue in 2023; and(ii)  the systems integration of LVB was completed in December 2022, and post-implementation reviews are currently in progress.\nBased on the internal controls established and maintained by the Group, work performed by internal and external auditors, reviews performed by management and various Board committees, as well as assurances received from and mitigation and remedial actions undertaken by management, the Board, with the concurrence of the AC is of the opinion that the Group\u2019s internal controls and risk management systems were adequate and e\u038d ective as at 31 December 2022 to address \n\u0234 nancial, operational, compliance risks and \ninformation technology risks which the Group considers relevant and material to its operations. The Board notes that the internal controls and risk management systems provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the Group will not be a \u038d ected by any event that could be \nreasonably foreseen as it strives to achieve its business objectives. In this regard, the Board also notes that no system can provide absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poor judgement in decision-making, human error, fraud or other irregularities.\nStrong culture\nE\u038d ective safeguards\nWe believe that e \u038d ective safeguards against \nundesired business conduct have to go beyond a \u201ctick-the-box\u201d mentality.

The results of our Risk Culture and Conduct Survey conducted in 2022 indicated a satisfactory risk culture bank-wide. In 2022, we continued to monitor our risk culture pulse with a risk culture and conduct dashboard, comprising multi-faceted indicators. Creating awareness remained a key focus as we continue to reinforce a strong culture of risk and control across all levels within the organisation. We leveraged digital communication channels to share culture- related content and conducted training with case studies to aid managers in strengthening the \u201cTone from the Middle\u201d and to enhance employee risk sensing and judgement. We continue to place emphasis on conduct as part of our compensation evaluation process.The DBS Code of Conduct (Code of Conduct) The Code of Conduct sets out the principles and standards of behaviour that are expected of employees of the Group (including part-time and temporary employees) when dealing with customers, business associates, regulators and colleagues.

A dedicated investor relations team supports the CEO and the CFO in maintaining a close and active dialogue with investors. The DBS website provides contact details for investors to submit their feedback and raise any questions.During the year, we held over 450 meetings with equity investors and over 100 meetings with debt investors.

The GDC\u2019s objectives are to: (a) periodically review DBS\u2019 disclosure policy and update it as needed, (b) ensure that all material disclosures are appropriate, complete and accurate, and (c) ensure selective or inadvertent disclosure of material information is avoided.Conduct of shareholder meetings  DBS encourages and values shareholder participation at its general meetings and was one of the \u0234 rst large market capitalisation \ncompanies to incorporate live voting and live question & answer functions at its fully virtual AGM in March 2022. The Chairman plays a pivotal role in fostering constructive dialogue between shareholders, Board members and management at general meetings. Resolutions requiring shareholders\u2019 approval are tabled separately for adoption at general meetings unless they are closely related and are more appropriately tabled together. DBS puts all resolutions at general meetings to a vote by electronic poll and announces the results by showing the number of votes cast for and against each resolution and the respective percentages. DBS appoints an independent external party as scrutineer for the electronic poll voting process. Prior to the commencement of a general meeting, the scrutineer would review the proxies and the electronic poll voting system as part of the proxy veri\u0234  cation process. At the general \nmeeting, handsets are provided for poll voting and the results of the electronic poll voting are announced immediately after each resolution has been put to a vote. DBS maintains an audit trail of all votes cast at the general meeting. The outcome of the general meeting (including detailed results of the poll vote for each resolution) is promptly disclosed on SGXNET within the same day after the conclusion of that meeting.Annual General Meetings (AGMs) provide shareholders with the opportunity to share their views and to interact with the Board, including the chairpersons of the Board committees and certain members of senior management.

Notably, return on equity, at 15%, signi \u0234 cantly surpassed previous records. \nDBS\u2019 sterling \u0234 nancial performance re \u0235 ected the bene \u0234 t of higher interest rates, the strength of a broad-based franchise and multi-year \ntransformation e \u038d orts. In particular, the bank\u2019s strengthened current and savings account base enabled it to enjoy higher leverage to rising in terest \nrates than in previous years, contributing to strong total income. Diversi \u0234 ed engines of growth also helped to mitigate the drag from lower wealth \nmanagement and investment banking fee income.   In 2022, DBS continued to make headway in growing its Asia franchise. In India, with the successful integration of Lakshmi Vila s Bank, DBS India now \nhas an enlarged platform that encompasses 2.5 million retail and 15,000 corporate customers. Income and pro \u0234 t rose for the year. Notwithstanding \nChina-US tensions, DBS\u2019 Greater Bay Area franchise also saw robust growth. In Taiwan, DBS is on track to complete the integrati on of Citi\u2019s consumer \nbanking business by August 2023.Solid progress was also made in cementing a new way of working. A multi-year e \u038d ort in industrialising arti \u0234 cial intelligence/ machine learning \ncontinued to deliver not just value to the customer but also revenue uplift to the bank. Ecosystem partnerships enabled the ban k to further scale \nits customer base outside Singapore without high acquisition costs. \u201cManaging through Journeys\u201d, which involves cross-functiona l squads working \nhorizontally to ensure the bank is truly customer- \u0234 rst, gained in maturity. \nDBS also continued to advance the sustainability agenda. The bank\u2019s net-zero roadmap is one of the most comprehensive in scope among global \nbanks. On the social impact front, DBS Foundation\u2019s new Community Impact Chapter committed SGD 5.6 million towards 10 programme s to help \nfoster a more equitable and inclusive society.Finally, DBS was named by Global Finance as \u201cWorld's Best Bank\u201d. This is the seventh global best bank award DBS has won in the past \u0234  ve years. \nThe bank was also the only Singapore-headquartered company to be recognised as one of the \"100 Best Workplaces for Innovators\" by US-based \nFast Company.

In addition, we continued to face a di \u025d  cult geopolitical situation, with tensions remaining elevated \nbetween the superpowers. \nDigital transformation A new wave of operational and systemic risks may be created as digital banking transformation programmes become more deeply embedded in the banking industry, all the while as customers and industry players become increasingly digitally savvy.  The challenges are compounded against a backdrop of higher workforce attrition and labour shortages in the tech space. \nMastering data and arti \u0234 cial \nintelligence (AI)As banks rise to the challenge of meeting consumer demand for banking experiences that are intuitive, they will need to re-architect legacy technology and their data stack. The ethics of using AI algorithms is also coming under strict scrutiny, especially in the areas of accountability, transparency, and data bias. Inability to manage both the transition and ethical issues, as well as leverage bene \u0234 ts from AI \ntechnologies will result in a loss of trust, competitiveness and market share.\nData governance Rapid digitisation has intensi \u0234 ed data collection and analytics, which are used to drive new business \ninitiatives. This has led to greater demands for enhanced standards of data protection and privacy.  A weak data governance framework for data capturing, data quality, and data use will increase the risk of non-compliance, \u0234 nancial losses, regulatory \u0234 nes, and reputational damage.\nHuman rights Insu\u025d  cient integration of human rights principles and human rights due diligence in our business \noperations may expose us to unintended and unforeseen legal, \u0234 nancial, and reputational risks. \nBuilding a great corporate culture The pandemic has permanently changed the way we live, learn and work and raised awareness of the importance of mental well-being for our people.  Companies that are unable to adapt their work practices and pay greater attention to employee well-being will face challenges in engaging and retaining their talent.  \nDriving diversity, equity &inclusion (DEI)Being an organisation that operates in 19 di \u038d erent markets, failure to embrace diversity, equity and \ninclusion will run us the risk of not being e \u038d ective in the communities that we operate in.

Our broad-based franchise and nimble execution enabled us to capture regional opportunities despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and \u0234 nancial market volatility. \nOur income was also boosted by a higher net interest margin.

Companies need to invest in upskilling and reskilling of their employees so as to be well-equipped in capturing and realising new growth areas for the business. \nEcosystem partnerships The acceleration of digital adoption is changing the way consumers and corporates behave, with increasing consumer engagement on digital platforms and businesses moving into direct-to-consumer models. The role of \u0234 nancial institutions as intermediaries is evolving as emerging technologies change the \nways market participants interact.As a result, \u0234 nancial services revenue pools are being disrupted and redistributed to new \nchallengers.\nResponsible \u0234  nancing  Insu\u025d  cient integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into our \nbusiness operations would expose the bank to various emerging risks such as climate-related physical and transition risks.

The rapid emergence of digital assets also increases the risks of money laundering and sanction evasion.\nCyber security The cyber risk landscape has worsened as cyber criminals and threat actors exploit a fractious environment instigated by heightened geopolitical tensions, to target our customers and sta \u038d  with \nincreasingly sophisticated attacks.\nFair dealing Customers expect us to put their interests \u0234 rst by providing relevant and accurate information, and \nappropriate recommendations in conducting our business.\nTransparency Transparency in disclosure promotes good governance, builds trust and drives better decision-making.

Additionally, both EC and RC are assessed as part of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment  Process (ICAAP).\nOur capital allocation structure monitors credit, market and operational risks by assessing regulatory capital utilisation at t he business unit level. \nThe diagram below shows how they are managed along the various dimensions.

Refer to Sections 5 through 9 for more information about each risk type.\n4.2  Stress testing\nStress testing is an integral part of our risk management process. It includes both sensitivity and scenario analyses, and is conducted regularly. In particular, the ICAAP (a group-wide exercise spanning di \u038d erent \nrisk types) is performed annually. In addition, stress tests are carried out in response to microeconomic and macroeconomic conditions, or portfolio developments. Every stress test is documented and the results are reviewed by senior management and/or the BRMC.Stress testing alerts senior management to our potential vulnerability to exceptional but plausible adverse events. As such, stress testing enables us to assess capital adequacy and identify potentially risky portfolio segments as well as inherent systematic risks. This then allows us to develop the right contingency plans, exit strategies and mitigating actions beforehand.The ICAAP ensures our business plans are consistent with our Risk Appetite. This is done by comparing the projected demand for capital to the projected supply of capital under various scenarios, including severe macroeconomic stress.\n5   Credit risk \nThe most signi \u0234 cant measurable risk \nDBS faces - credit risk - arises from our daily activities in our various businesses. These activities include lending to retail, corporate and institutional customers. It includes the risk of lending, pre-settlement and settlement risk of foreign exchange, derivatives and securities.\nRefer to Note 43.1 to the \u0234 nancial statements on \npage 172 for details on DBS\u2019 maximum exposure to credit risk.Risk Limits, Triggers and Controls\nManage concentration risk \nby using triggers, limits and \nmonitoringManage market risk by using \nlimitsManage through maintaining \ncounterbalancing capacity to \nmeet liquidity risk exposureManage through policies \nand standardsCredit Risk\n\u2022 Sector\n\u2022 Country (transfer risk)\n\u2022 Environmental, Social and Governance risksMarket Risk\n\u2022 Business Unit\n\u2022 Entity/ Location\n\u2022 Desk (where applicable)Liquidity Risk\n\u2022 Currency\n\u2022 LocationOperational and \nReputational RisksHeadroom\nConsumer  \nBanking\nCredit RiskInstitutional \nBanking\nCredit RiskCentral \nOperations\nCredit RiskCommercial Book Treasury MarketsCapital Allocation\nMarket RiskTreasury            \nMarkets\nCredit Risk\nMarket RiskOperational Risk\n85 Risk management\n5.1   Credit risk management at DBS\nDBS' approach to credit risk management comprises the following building blocks:\nPoliciesRisk methodologiesProcesses, systems and reports\nPoliciesThe dimensions of credit risk and the scope of its application are de \u0234 ned in the Group Credit \nRisk Management Policy. Senior management sets the overall direction and policy for managing credit risk at the enterprise level.The Group Core Credit Risk Policies (CCRPs) established for Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management and Institutional Banking set forth the principles by which DBS conducts its credit risk management and control activities. These policies, supplemented by a number of operational standards and guides, ensure consistency in identifying, assessing, underwriting, measuring, reporting and controlling credit risk across DBS, and provide guidance in the formulation of business-speci\u0234  c and/ or location-speci \u0234 c credit risk \npolicies and standards.The operational standards and guides are established to provide greater details on the implementation of the credit principles within the Group CCRPs and are adapted to re \u0235 ect \ndi\u038d erent credit environments and portfolio \nrisk pro\u0234  les. The CCRPs are approved by the \nGroup Chief Credit O \u025d  cer.\nRisk methodologiesCredit risk is managed by thoroughly understanding our wholesale customers - the businesses they are in, as well as the economies in which they operate.

It is also managed through statistical models and data analytics for retail customers.The assignment of credit risk ratings and setting of lending limits are integral parts of DBS\u2019 credit risk management process, and we use an array of rating models for our wholesale and retail portfolios. Most of these models are built internally using DBS\u2019 loss data, and the limits are driven by DBS\u2019 Risk Appetite Statement and the Target Market and Risk Acceptance Criteria (TM-RAC).Wholesale borrowers are assessed individually, and further reviewed and evaluated by experienced credit risk managers who consider relevant credit risk factors in the \u0234 nal determination of the borrower\u2019s risk. For some portfolios within the SME segment, DBS also uses a programme-based approach to achieve a balanced management of risks and rewards. Retail exposures are assessed using credit score models, credit bureau records as well as internally and externally available customer behaviour records supplemented by our Risk Acceptance Criteria (RAC). Credit applications are proposed by the business units, and applications outside the RAC are independently assessed by the credit risk managers.\nRefer to Section 5.3 on page 88 to read more about our internal credit risk models. \nPre-settlement credit risk for traded products arising from a counterparty potentially defaulting on its obligations is quanti \u0234 ed \nby evaluation of the mark-to-market value, plus potential future exposure. This is included within DBS\u2019 overall credit limits to counterparties for internal risk management.We actively monitor and manage our exposure to counterparties for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative trades to protect our balance sheet in the event of a counterparty default. Counterparty risk exposures that may be adversely a \u038d ected by market risk events \nare identi \u0234 ed, reviewed and acted upon \nby management, and highlighted to the appropriate risk committees. Speci \u0234 c wrong-\nway risk arises when the credit exposure of a counterparty (from the traded product transaction) directly correlates with the probability of default of the counterparty. DBS has processes in place to guide the handling of speci\u0234 c wrong-way risk transactions, \nand its risk measurement metric takes into account the higher risks associated with such transactions.Issuer default risk that may also arise from derivatives, notes and securities are generally measured based on jump-to-default computations.Concentration risk managementFor credit risk concentration, we use EC as our measurement tool as it combines the individual risk factors such as the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD), in addition to industry correlation and portfolio concentration. EC thresholds are set to ensure that the allocated EC stays within our Risk Appetite. Concentration risk for retail is managed at two levels \u2013 product level where exposure limits are set up, and segment level to manage the growth of high-risk segments. Governance processes are in place to ensure that these thresholds are monitored regularly, and appropriate actions are taken when the thresholds are breached.DBS continually examines and reviews how we can enhance the scope of our thresholds and approaches to manage concentration risk.Environmental, social and governance risksResponsible \u0234  nancing, covering \nenvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, is a topic of increasing importance that a\u038d  ects investing and \u0234 nancing decisions \nacross the bank. DBS recognises that our \u0234 nancing practices have a substantial impact \non society and failure of our customers to appropriately manage ESG issues can directly impact their operations and long-term economic viability, as well as the communities and environment in which they operate.DBS considers ESG risks as critical in our pursuit of business strategies. The Board approves DBS\u2019 overall and speci \u0234 c risk \ngovernance frameworks and oversees an independent Group-wide risk management system. In 2022, the Board approved the incorporation of environmental risk considerations into our Risk Appetite Statement.

Limits for all other non-priority countries are set using a model-based approach.Risk appetite for each country is approved by the BRMC, while transfer risk limits are approved by the Board EXCO and senior management.Credit stress testingDBS engages in various types of credit stress testing, and these are driven either by regulators or internal requirements and management. Our credit stress tests are performed at the total portfolio or sub-portfolio level, and are generally conducted to assess the impact of changing economic conditions on asset quality, earnings performance, capital adequacy and liquidity. DBS\u2019 stress testing programme is comprehensive and covers a range of risks and business areas.DBS typically performs the following types of credit stress testing at a minimum and others as necessary:\nPillar 1 credit stress testingDBS conducts Pillar 1 credit stress testing regularly as required by regulators. Under Pillar 1 credit stress testing, DBS assesses the impact of a mild stress scenario (at least two consecutive quarters of zero growth) on Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) estimates (i.e. PD, LGD and EAD) and the impact on regulatory capital. The purpose of the Pillar 1 credit stress test is to assess the robustness of internal credit risk models and the cushion above minimum regulatory capital.\nPillar 2 credit stress testingDBS conducts Pillar 2 credit stress testing once a year as part of the ICAAP. Under Pillar 2 credit stress testing, DBS assesses the impact of stress scenarios, with di \u038d erent levels of severity, on asset quality, earnings \nperformance as well as internal and regulatory capital. The results of the credit stress test form inputs to the capital planning process under ICAAP. The purpose of the Pillar 2 credit stress testing is to examine, in a rigorous and forward-looking manner, the possible events or changes in market conditions that could adversely impact DBS and to develop the appropriate action plan.\nIndustry-wide stress testingDBS participates in the annual industry-wide stress test (IWST) conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to facilitate the ongoing assessment of Singapore\u2019s \u0234 nancial stability. Under the IWST, DBS is required to \nassess the impact of adverse scenarios, as de \u0234 ned by the regulator, on asset quality, earnings performance and \ncapital adequacy, where applicable.\nSensitivity and scenario analysesDBS also conducts multiple independent sensitivity analyses and credit portfolio reviews based on various scenarios. The intent of these analyses and reviews is to identify vulnerabilities for the purpose of developing and executing mitigating actions.\nProcesses, systems and reportsDBS constantly invests in systems to support risk monitoring and reporting for our Institutional Banking and Consumer Banking/ Wealth Management businesses.The end-to-end credit process is continually being reviewed and improved through various front-to-back initiatives involving business, operations, risk management and other key stakeholders. Day-to-day monitoring of credit exposures, portfolio performance and external environmental factors potentially a \u038d ecting \ncredit risk pro\u0234  les is key to our philosophy of \ne\u038d ective credit risk management.\nIn addition, credit trends, which may include industry analysis, early warning alerts and signi\u0234  cant weak credits, are submitted to the various risk committees, allowing key strategies and action plans to be formulated and evaluated. Credit control functions also ensure that any credit risk taken complies with the credit risk policies and standards. These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses and policy exceptions are appropriately endorsed, compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established are monitored.Independent risk management functions that report to the CRO are jointly responsible for developing and maintaining a robust credit stress testing programme. These units oversee the implementation of credit stress tests as well as the analysis of the results, of which management, various risk committees and regulators are informed.Non-performing assetsDBS\u2019 credit facilities are classi \u0234 ed as \n\u201cPerforming assets\u201d or \u201cNon-performing assets\u201d (NPA), in accordance with the MAS Notice to Banks No. 612 \u201cCredit Files, Grading and Provisioning\u201d (MAS Notice 612).Credit exposures are categorised into one of the following \u0234 ve categories, according to our \nassessment of a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a credit facility from its normal sources of income and/ or the repayment behaviour of the borrower.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5060, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28aa32e0-634e-454d-bb2b-03445eb6b82f": {"__data__": {"id_": "28aa32e0-634e-454d-bb2b-03445eb6b82f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cc476741-c87b-4306-b2ce-7f8b8814922c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "e475db0acfb16e7fe5df08e123b43cc9a2ba0f1856a4e3da410eaefcd9e2425e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "44f82730-5650-42d5-b9f4-35fab20cb86c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "93ab10687e5612ebe82f009c923905b60c0096b73a72a7a5274016ae79d5ead4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "004af8bd-2f63-48b9-afb7-f87d5dc19a4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58a3bdce72e2353240902bab733b24f66d3f28d60da946353bf55f82fa317f0c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "fc4d1b943d20d0031299be3a167bf3b6562173017ac46111448e72e5d5cc40f0", "text": "These functions ensure that approved limits are activated, credit excesses and policy exceptions are appropriately endorsed, compliance with credit standards is carried out, and covenants established are monitored.Independent risk management functions that report to the CRO are jointly responsible for developing and maintaining a robust credit stress testing programme.

Collateral is generally diversi \u0234 ed and periodic valuations \nof collateral are required.

This is governed by internal guidelines with respect to collateral eligibility. In the event of a default, the credit risk exposure is reduced by master-netting arrangements where DBS is allowed to o \u038d set what we owe a counterparty \nagainst what is due from that counterparty in a netting-eligible jurisdiction.\nRefer to Note 15 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page \n143 for further information on \u0234 nancial assets and \nliabilities subject to netting agreement but not o \u038d set \non the balance sheet. \nCollateral held against derivatives generally consists of cash in major currencies and highly rated government or quasi- government bonds. Exceptions may arise in certain countries, where due to domestic capital markets and business conditions, the bank may be required to accept less highly rated or liquid government bonds and currencies.

As at 31 December 2022, for a three-notch downgrade of its Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Services ratings, DBS will have to post additional collateral amounting to SGD 11 million (2021: SGD 2 million). Other credit risk mitigants DBS accepts guarantees as credit risk mitigants. Internal requirements for considering the eligibility of guarantors for credit risk mitigation are in place.\n5.3  Internal credit risk models \nDBS adopts rating systems for the di \u038d erent \nasset classes under the Internal Ratings - Based Approach (IRBA). There is a robust governance process for the development, independent validation and approval of any credit risk model. The models go through a rigorous review process before they are endorsed by the GCRMC and Risk EXCO. They must also be approved by the BRMC before submission for regulatory approval. The key risk measures generated by the internal credit risk rating models to quantify regulatory capital include PD, LGD and EAD. For portfolios under the Foundation IRBA, internal estimates of PD are used while the supervisory LGD and EAD estimates are applied. For portfolios under the Advanced IRBA, internal estimates of PD, LGD and EAD are used. In addition, the ratings from the credit models act as the basis for underwriting credit risk, monitoring portfolio performance and determining business strategies. The performance of the rating systems is monitored regularly and reported to the GCRMC, Risk EXCO and BRMC to ensure their ongoing e \u038d ectiveness. \nAn independent risk unit conducts formal validations for the respective rating systems annually. The validation processes are also independently reviewed by Group Audit. These serve to highlight material deterioration in the rating systems for management attention.\n5.3.1  Retail exposure models \nRetail exposures are categorised into the following asset classes under the Advanced IRBA: residential mortgages, qualifying revolving retail exposures, and other retail exposures. Within each asset class, exposures are managed on a portfolio basis. Each customer or account is assigned to a risk pool, considering factors such as borrower characteristics and collateral type. PD, EAD and LGD estimates are based on internal historical default, utilisation and realised losses within a de\u0234 ned period. \nProduct-speci\u0234  c credit risk elements such \nas underwriting criteria, scoring models, approving authorities, asset quality, and business strategy reviews, as well as systems, processes and techniques to monitor portfolio performance, are in place. Credit risk models for secured and unsecured portfolios are also used to update the risk level of each loan on a monthly basis, re \u0235 ecting the broad usage of \nrisk models in portfolio quality reviews. \n5.3.2  Wholesale exposure      m o d e l s  \nWholesale exposures are largely under the Foundation IRBA for capital computation. They include sovereign, bank and corporate. Specialised lending exposures are under IRBA using supervisory slotting criteria. Sovereign exposures are risk-rated using internal risk-rating models. Factors related to country-speci\u0234  c macroeconomic risk, political \nrisk, social risk and liquidity risk are included in the sovereign rating models to assess the sovereign credit risk in an objective and systematic manner. Bank exposures are assessed using the bank-rating model. The model considers both quantitative and qualitative factors such as capital levels and liquidity, asset quality and management strength.Large corporate exposures are assessed using internal rating model. Factors considered in the risk assessment process include the counterparty\u2019s \u0234 nancial strength \nand qualitative factors such as industry risk, access to funding, market standing and management strength. SME credit rating models consider risk factors such as those relating to the counterparty\u2019s \u0234 nancial strength, qualitative factors, as well as \naccount performance. Credit risk ratings under the IRBA portfolios are, at a minimum, reviewed by designated approvers on an annual basis unless credit conditions require more frequent assessment. \n5.3.3  Specialised lending      exposures \nSpecialised lending IRBA portfolios include income-producing real estate, project \u0234 nance, \nobject \u0234  nance, and commodities \u0234 nance. \nThese adopt the supervisory slotting criteria speci\u0234  ed under Annex 7v of MAS Notice 637, \nwhich are used to determine the risk weights to calculate credit risk-weighted exposures. 5.3.4  Securitisation exposures \nWe arrange securitisation transactions for our clients for fees.

For transactions that are not underwritten, no securitisation exposures are assumed as a direct consequence of arranging the transactions. Any decision to invest in any of such arranged transactions is subject to independent risk assessment.

These may include securitisation transactions arranged by us or with other parties. We may also act as a liquidity facility provider, working capital facility provider or swap counterparty. Such securitisation exposures require the approval of the independent risk function and are subject to regular risk reviews. We also have processes in place to monitor the credit risk of our securitisation exposures. \n5.3.5   Credit exposures falling      outside internal credit risk      m o d e l s  \nDBS applies the Standardised Approach (SA) for portfolios that are expected to transit to IRBA or for portfolios that are immaterial in terms of size and risk pro \u0234 le.

Prior to regulatory approval, these portfolios are under SA. The portfolios under the SA are subject to our overall governance framework and credit risk management practices. DBS continues to monitor the size and risk pro \u0234 le of these \nportfolios and will enhance the relevant risk measurement processes if these risk exposures become material. DBS uses external ratings for credit exposures under the SA where relevant, and we only accept ratings from Standard & Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s and Fitch in such cases. DBS follows the process prescribed in MAS Notice 637 to map the ratings to the relevant risk weights.\n89 Risk management\n5.4.

Property valuations are determined using a combination of professional appraisals and housing price indices. For Singapore mortgage loans, the increases in property price index for HDB and private residential properties drove a shift of 14.8% from the LTV > 50% band to up to 50% LTV band.For Hong Kong mortgage loans, there was an approximate 25.1% increase in the proportion of mortgage exposure in the 51% to 80% LTV band, as property price index decreased by 15.2% and 12.7% for Urban and New Territory region respectively in 2022.For Rest of Greater China, the shift in the proportion of mortgage exposure to the up to 50% LTV band was mainly driven by the increase in property price index for Taiwan mortgage by 15.6% in 2022.\nRefer to Note 43.4 to the \u0234 nancial statements on page 176 for DBS\u2019 breakdown of credit risk concentration.415\n8%\n14%17%\n202115%\n46%415\n20218%\n10%\n9%7%\n11%19%26%\n10%", "start_char_idx": 8099, "end_char_idx": 9857, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a689ee62-e5ff-471c-a6f0-fb8dcfcf96f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "a689ee62-e5ff-471c-a6f0-fb8dcfcf96f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9dbff670-bd81-4f46-a763-0842c8787d80", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "aee0ca37e3ead3a8ba5460d409f11ea0c1eccb19cd8a8b4bcc9517ae7cbea8bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95d38618-8478-4bd5-a1a1-61a029d995df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "d041b9f3f604ed696bd4ebdeb617a8b1d0624587163dae12b26d3bcb1b62a431", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "850da6d1-cc24-4ff6-be0d-01b951354ca8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02ae1c6c10742001d76b4d5e6c08b20b7bda414bf65b4f790b1fe51fc4799de0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "93807e98211bbf263e039d816ca272f75036dabfa84ac99c6d6dee367402516f", "text": "90 A Di\u038d  erent Kind of Bank  DBS Annual Report 2022\nPercentage of residential mortgage loans (breakdown by LTV band and geography) As at 31 December 2022\nLoans and advances to corporates secured by real estateThese secured loans were extended for the purpose of acquisition and/ or development of real estate, as well as for general wor king capital. \nMore than 90% of such loans were fully collateralised and majority of these loans had LTV < 80%.

This policy is supplemented with standards and guides, which facilitate the identification, measurement, control, monitoring and reporting of market risk in a consistent manner. They also set out the overall approach, requirements and controls governing market risk stress testingacross DBS.The criteria for determining the positions to be included in the trading book are stipulated in the Trading Book Policy Statement.Risk methodologiesDBS utilises Value-at-Risk (VaR), a statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential loss from market movements. This measure uses historical simulation based on data for the previous 12 months. It assumes that historical changes in market values re \u0235 ect \nthe distribution of potential outcomes in the immediate future.DBS limits and monitors market risk exposures using Expected Shortfall (ES) that is VaR calculated with a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss methodology which approximates a 97.5% con \u0234 dence interval.\nES is supplemented with other risk control metrics such as sensitivities to risk factors and loss triggers for management action.DBS conducts backtesting to verify the predictiveness of the VaR model. Backtesting compares VaR calculated for positions at the close of each business day with the pro \u0234 t and \nloss (P&L) that arises from those positions on the following business day. The backtesting P&L excludes fees and commissions, revenues from intra-day trading, non-daily valuation adjustments and time e \u038d ects.For backtesting, VaR at the 99% con \u0234 dence \ninterval and over a one-day holding period is used. We adopt the standardised approach to compute market risk regulatory capital under MAS Notice 637 and MAS Notice FHC-N637 for the trading book positions. As such, VaR backtesting does not impact our regulatory capital for market risk.There are limitations to VaR models; for example, past changes in market risk factors may not provide accurate predictions of future market movements, and the risk arising from adverse market events may not be considered.To monitor DBS\u2019 vulnerability to unexpected but plausible extreme market risk-related events, we conduct multiple market risk stress tests regularly. These cover trading and non-trading portfolios and follow a combination of historical and hypothetical scenarios depicting risk-factor movement.Economic Value of Equity (EVE) and Net Interest Income (NII) variability are the speci\u0234 c key risk metrics used to assess \nour interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB). EVE and NII variability measure how the economic value and earnings of the bank change under both regulatory and/ or internal scenarios. Credit risk arising from loans and receivables is managed under the credit risk management framework.IRRBB arises from mismatches in the interest rate pro\u0234  les of assets, liabilities and capital \ninstruments. Estimating IRRBB requires the use of behavioural models and assumptions on certain parameters such as loan prepayment, \u0234 xed deposits early redemption \nand the duration of non-maturity deposits. DBS measures IRRBB on a monthly basis.Processes, systems and reportsRobust internal control processes and systems have been designed and implemented to support our market risk management approach. DBS reviews these control processes and systems regularly, and these reviews allow senior management to assess their e\u038d  ectiveness.\nThe RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit - an independent market risk management function reporting to the CRO - monitors, controls and analyses DBS\u2019 market risk daily.

It assesses the adequacy of our counterbalancing capacity to fund or mitigate any cash \u0235 ow shortfalls that may occur as \nforecasted in the cash \u0235 ow movements across \nsuccessive time bands. To ensure that liquidity is managed in line with our Risk Appetite, core parameters such as the types of scenarios, the survival period and the minimum level of liquid assets, are pre-speci \u0234 ed for monitoring \nand control on a group-wide basis. Any occurrences of forecasted shortfalls that cannot be covered by our counterbalancing capacity will be escalated to the relevant committees for evaluation and action. Liquidity risk stress testing is performed regularly using cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch \nanalysis, and covers adverse scenarios including general market and idiosyncratic stress scenarios. Stress tests assess our vulnerability when liability run-o \u038d s increase, \nasset rollovers increase and/ or liquid asset bu\u038d ers decrease. In addition, ad hoc stress \ntests are performed as part of our recovery planning and ICAAP exercises. Liquidity risk control measures such as liquidity-related ratios and balance sheet analysis are complementary tools for cash \u0235 ow maturity mismatch analysis, and they are \nperformed regularly to obtain deeper insights and \u0234 ner control over our liquidity pro \u0234 le \nacross di\u038d  erent locations. \nThe liquidity risk control measures also include concentration measures regarding top depositors, wholesale borrowing and swapped funds ratios. Processes, systems and reports Robust internal control processes and systems support our overall approach in identifying, measuring, aggregating, controlling and monitoring liquidity risk across DBS. Continuous improvement in data and reporting platforms has allowed most elements of internal liquidity risk reporting to be centralised. The RMG Market and Liquidity Risk unit manages the day-to-day liquidity risk monitoring, control reporting and analysis. Liquidity management and funding strategy DBS strives to develop a diversified funding base with access to funding sources across retail and wholesale channels. Our funding strategy is anchored on the strength of our core deposit franchise and is augmented by our established long-term funding capabilities.\nDBS aims to maintain continuous access to the investor base for capital and senior wholesale funding to support our commercial banking \nactivities. We seek cost e \u025d  ciencies over the long term and to broaden our investor base through proactive and frequent engagement.

To this end, where practicable and transferable without loss in value, we make appropriate use of swap markets for relevant currencies, commensurate with the liquidity of each, in the conversion and deployment of surplus funds across locations. As these swaps typically mature earlier than loans, we are exposed to potential cash \u0235 ow mismatches arising from the risk that \ncounterparties may not roll over maturing swaps to support our ongoing funding needs.

DBS\u2019 objective is to keep operational risk at appropriate levels, taking into account the markets we operate in, the characteristics of the businesses as well as our economic and regulatory environment. \n8.1   Operational risk management at DBS\nDBS' approach to operational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\nPoliciesRisk methodologiesProcesses, systems and reports\nPoliciesThe Group Operational Risk Management (ORM) Policy sets our overall approach for managing operational risk in a structured, systematic and consistent manner. \n97 Risk management\nThere are policies, standards, tools and programmes in place to govern ORM practices across DBS. These include corporate operational risk policies and standards that are owned by the respective corporate oversight and control functions. The key policies address risk areas relating to technology, compliance, fraud, money laundering, \u0234 nancing of terrorism \nand sanctions, new product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership. Risk methodologiesDBS adopts the standardised approach to compute operational risk regulatory capital. To manage and control operational risk, we use various tools, including risk and control self-assessment (RCSA), operational risk event management and key risk indicator monitoring. DBS\u2019 Three Lines Model adopts one common risk taxonomy, and a consistent risk assessment approach to managing operational risk. RCSA is conducted by each business or support unit to identify key operational risk and assess the e \u038d ectiveness of internal controls. \nWhen control issues are identi \u0234 ed, the units \ndevelop action plans and track the resolution of the issues. Operational risk events are classi \u0234 ed in \naccordance with Basel standards. Such events, including any signi \u0234 cant incidents \nthat may impact DBS\u2019 reputation, must be reported based on certain established thresholds. Key risk indicators with pre-de\u0234 ned escalation triggers are employed to \nfacilitate risk monitoring in a forward-looking manner. Additional methodologies are in place to address subject-speci \u0234 c risks, including, but not \nlimited to, the following: Technology riskInformation Technology (IT) risk is managed through an enterprise technology risk management approach. This covers risk identi\u0234  cation, assessment, mitigation, \nmonitoring and reporting. In addition, the appropriate governance, IT policies and standards, control processes and risk mitigation programmes are in place to support the risk management approach. Cyber security riskCyber security risk is a continuous focus of the bank. The Chief Information Security O \u025d  cer \n(CISO) oversees the cyber security function and the one-stop competency centre for all cyber security related matters, such as operational risks, data protection risks and compliance with cyber security related regulations. DBS places signi \u0234 cant emphasis to secure our \npeople, information, network, equipment and applications in accordance with the Bank\u2019s risk appetite. The Bank continues to devote signi\u0234 cant resources to improve our cyber \nhygiene and control environment to stay ahead of the cyber threat curve. The CISO o \u025d  ce, as the second line, conducts regular assessments to validate the e \u025d  cacy of our controls and \nobtain assurance that our control framework remains e \u038d ective against emerging and \nevolving threats.

We implement surveillance and compliance testing controls where necessary to obtain assurance that the control framework is operating e \u038d ectively. \nDBS also provides relevant training and implements assurance processes. We strongly believe in the need to promote a strong compliance culture as well, and this is developed through the leadership of our Board and senior management. New product, outsourcing and ecosystem partnership risksEach new product, service, outsourcing arrangement or ecosystem partnership is subject to a risk review and sign-o \u038d  process, \nwhere relevant risks are identi \u0234 ed and \nassessed. Variations of existing products or services and existing outsourcing arrangements and ecosystem partnerships are also subject to a similar process. Other mitigation programmesA robust business continuity management programme is in place to ensure that essential banking services can continue in the event of unforeseen events or business disruptions. This includes a crisis management plan to enable quick response to manage incidents. Exercises are conducted annually, simulating di\u038d erent scenarios to test business continuity \nplans and crisis management protocol. The e\u038d ectiveness of these exercises as \nwell as DBS\u2019 business continuity readiness and our alignment to regulatory guidelines are communicated and attested by senior management to the BRMC annually. DBS' management of the Covid-19 pandemic \nhas demonstrated the e \u025d  \n cacy of our business \ncontinuity plans, keeping the bank in good stead. We were able to quickly adapt and adjust to the pandemic to ensure minimal impact on our customers and assure the health and safety of our employees. We dialled up our work-from home capabilities by leveraging technology and data, and proactively managed the operational risks which arose from new or revised processes as we moved towards a hybrid work arrangement.

These risks include: \u2022 Financial risk (credit, market and liquidity risks) \n\u2022 Inherent risk (operational and business/ strategic risks)\n9.1  Reputational risk      management at DBS \nDBS\u2019 approach to reputational risk management comprises the following building blocks:\nPoliciesRisk methodologiesProcesses, systems and reports\nPolicies DBS adopts a four-step approach for reputational risk management, which is to prevent, detect, escalate and respond to reputational risk events. As reputational risk is typically a consequence of the failure to manage other risk types, the de\u0234 nitions and principles for managing such risks are articulated in the respective risk policies. These are reinforced by sound corporate values that re \u0235 ect ethical \nbehaviours and practices throughout DBS. At DBS, we have policies in place to protect the consistency of our brand and to safeguard our corporate identity and reputation. Risk methodologies Under the various risk policies, we have established a number of mechanisms for ongoing risk monitoring. These mechanisms take the form of risk limits, key risk indicators, conduct/ culture and other operating metrics, and include the periodic risk and control self-assessment process. Apart from observations from internal sources, alerts from external parties/ stakeholders also serve as an important source to detect potential reputational risk events. In addition, there are policies relating to media communications, social media and corporate social responsibility to protect DBS\u2019 reputation. There are also escalation and response mechanisms in place for managing reputational risk. While the respective risk policies address the individual risk types, the Reputational Risk Policy focuses speci \u0234 cally on our \nstakeholders\u2019 perception of how well DBS manages its reputational risks. Stakeholders include customers, government agencies and regulators, investors, rating agencies, business alliances, vendors, trade unions, the media, the general public, the Board and senior management, and DBS\u2019 employees. We recognise that creating a sense of shared value through engagement with key stakeholder groups is imperative for our brand and reputation. \nRead more about our stakeholder engagement on page 80. \nProcesses, systems and reports Our units are responsible for the day-to-day management of reputational risk, and ensure that processes and procedures are in place to identify, assess and respond to this risk.

The Board articulates this objective in the form of capital targets. This objective is pursued while delivering returns to shareholders and ensuring that adequate capital resources are available for business growth and investment opportunities as well as adverse situations, taking into consideration our strategic plans and risk appetite.  Our dividend policy is to pay sustainable dividends that grow progressively with earnings. In line with this, the Board proposed a \u0234 nal dividend of 42 cents per share, an \nincrease of six cents from the previous payout, and a special dividend of 50 cents per share. The combined payout of 92 cents per share re\u0235 ects our robust earnings pro \u0234 le and strong \ncapital position. Together with the ordinary dividends of 36 cents per share for each of the \u0234 rst three quarters, the total dividend \npayout for the \u0234 nancial year rose to SGD 2.00 \nper share, a 67% increase from the SGD 1.20 per share for \u0234 nancial year 2021. Barring \nunforeseen circumstances, the annualised dividend will rise to SGD 1.68 per share. The Scrip Dividend Scheme will not be applied to the \u0234 nal and special dividends, having been \nsuspended since June 2021.\nProcess\nOur capital management objective is implemented via a capital management and planning process that is overseen by the Capital Committee. The Chief Financial O \u025d  cer \nchairs the Capital Committee. The Capital Committee receives regular updates on our current and projected capital position. A key tool for capital planning is the annual Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) through which we assess our projected capital supply and demand relative to regulatory requirements and our capital targets. The ICAAP generally has a three-year horizon and covers various scenarios, including stress scenarios of di \u038d ering scope and severity.\nCapital capacity is allocated on two dimensions: by business line and by entity. Capital allocations by business line are set as part of the budget process and monitored during the year. Return on regulatory capital is one of several metrics used to measure business performance. Capital allocations by entity seek to optimise the distribution of capital resources across entities, taking into account the capital adequacy requirements imposed on each subsidiary in its respective jurisdiction. Capital is allocated to ensure that each subsidiary is able to comply with regulatory requirements as it executes its business strategy in line with our strategy.During the course of the year, these subsidiaries did not experience any impediments to the distribution of dividends.\nCapital structure\nWe manage our capital structure in line with our capital management objective and seek to optimise the cost and \u0235 exibility o\u038d  ered by \nvarious capital resources. In order to achieve this, we assess the need and the opportunity to raise or retire capital.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) expects jurisdictions to implement the countercyclical bu \u038d er \nduring periods of excessive credit growth.

Under the MAS\u2019 framework for identifying and supervising D-SIBs, the higher loss absorbency requirement for locally incorporated D-SIBs is met by the foregoing minimum ratios being two percentage points higher than those established by the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee has developed an indicator-based methodology for identifying  global systemically \nimportant banks (G-SIBs) on which higher loss absorbency requirements will be imposed. While we are not a G-SIB, we are required to disclose the set of indicators which are included in the Group\u2019s Pillar 3 disclosures published on DBS website (https://www.dbs.com/investors/de fault.page).\nOn 19 December 2022, the MAS announced that the implementation of the \u0234 nal Basel III reforms in Singapore will be deferred to between 1 January \n2024 and 1 January 2025. This move is to allow the industry su \u025d  cient time for proper implementation of systems needed to adopt the revised \nframework, and is aligned with the implementation timelines of other major jurisdictions.

An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the \nconsolidated \u0234  nancial statements are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in \u0235 uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the \nconsolidated \u0234  nancial statements.\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including the overall group  materiality for the \nconsolidated \u0234  nancial statements as a whole, as set out in the table below. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to de termine \nthe scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the e \u038d ect of misstatements, both individually and \non the \u0234 nancial statements as a whole.\nIn performing our audit, we allocated materiality levels to the signi \u0234 cant components and other components of the Group.

The Group\u2019s \n\u0234 nancial reporting process is dependent on its Information Technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Our audit scope included testing the oper ating e\u038d ectiveness \nofbthe controls over the integrity of key \u0234 nancial data processed through the IT systems that are relevant to \u0234 nancial reporting.\nIn establishing the overall Group audit approach, we determined the extent of audit procedures that were needed to be performed  across the \nGroup by us or by other PwC network \u0234 rms, operating under our instruction, who are familiar with the local laws and regulations in each respective \nterritory, (the \u201ccomponent auditors\u201d).

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assu rance, but is not a \nguarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstateme nts can arise from \nfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in \u0235 uence the economic decisions \nofbusers taken on the basis of these \u0234 nancial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the \u0234 nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit \nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su \u025d  cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk \nofbnot detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, \nintentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in t he circumstances, \nbut not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e \u038d ectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n\u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence o btained, \nwhether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi \u0234 cant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going \nconcern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the re lated disclosures in \nthe \u0234 nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.

Summary of Signi \u0234 cant \nAccounting Policies\n2.1  Basis of preparation\nCompliance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I))The \u0234 nancial statements of the Company and the consolidated \u0234 nancial \nstatements of the Group are prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (SFRS(I)). As permitted by Section 201(10)(b) of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act), the Company\u2019s income statement has not been included in these \u0234 nancial statements.\nThe \u0234 nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars and \nrounded to the nearest million, unless otherwise stated.\n2.2  Signi \u0234 cant estimates and judgement\nThe preparation of \u0234 nancial statements requires management to \nexercise judgement, use estimates and make assumptions in the application of policies and in reporting the amounts in the \u0234 nancial \nstatements. Although these estimates are based on management\u2019s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results may di \u038d er from \nthese estimates. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are signi \u0234 cant to the \u0234 nancial statements, and areas involving a \nhigher degree of judgement and complexity, are disclosed in Note 3.2.3   New or amended SFRS(I) e \u038d ective for 2022 \nyear-end \nThe amendments e \u038d ective from 1 January 2022 did not have signi \u0234 cant \nimpact on the Group\u2019s \u0234 nancial statements.\n2.4   New SFRS(I) and Interpretations e \u038d ective for \nfuture periods \nThe amendments and interpretations e \u038d ective for future periods do not \nhave a signi \u0234 cant impact on the Group\u2019s \u0234 nancial statements. \nA)  General Accounting Policies\nA summary of the signi \u0234 cant group accounting policies is described \nfurther below starting with those relating to the entire \u0234 nancial \nstatements, followed by those relating to the income statement, the balance sheet and other speci \u0234 c topics. This does not re \u0235 ect the \nrelative importance of these policies to the Group. \n2.5   Group Accounting\nSubsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a \u038d ect those returns through its power over the entity.\nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control is transferred to the Group to the date control ceases. The acquisition method is used to account for business combinations. Please refer to Note 2.13 for the Group\u2019s accounting policy on goodwill.All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.

The Group\u2019s \u0234  nancial statements are presented in Singapore dollars, which \nis the functional currency of the Company. Foreign currency transactions and balancesTransactions in foreign currencies are measured using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the entity undertaking the transaction at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange di \u038d erences arising from this translation are recognised in the \nincome statement within \u201cNet trading income\u201d. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair values are determined, which is generally the balance sheet date. Unrealised foreign exchange di \u038d erences arising from non-monetary \n\u0234 nancial assets and liabilities classi \u0234 ed as fair value through pro \u0234 t or \nloss (FVPL) are recognised in the income statement as trading income. Non-monetary \u0234 nancial assets that are classi \u0234 ed at fair value through \nother comprehensive income (FVOCI) relates mainly to FVOCI equities.

When a foreign operation is partially or fully disposed of, or when it is liquidated, such exchange di \u038d erences \nare recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss.\nFor acquisitions prior to 1 January 2005, the foreign exchange rates at the respective dates of acquisition were used. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation on or after 1 January 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the closing rate. Please refer to Note 28 forban overview of goodwill recorded. \n2.7  Segment reporting\nOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to management. In preparing the segment information, amounts for each business segment are shown after the allocation of certain centralised costs, funding income and the application of transfer pricing, where appropriate. Transactions between segments are recorded within the segment as if they are third party transactions and are eliminated on consolidation.

Where applicable, \nabvaluation reserve or pricing adjustment is applied to arrive at the fair \nvalue. The determination of fair value is considered a signi \u0234 cant accounting \npolicy for the Group and further details are disclosed in Note 42. O\u038d setting\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented net when there is a legally enforceable right to o \u038d set the recognised amounts and there is an \nintention to settle them on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle thebliability simultaneously. \nDerecognitionFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash \u0235 ows \nfrom the \u0234 nancial assets have expired or when they have been transferred \ntogether with substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.The Group enters into certain transactions where it transfers \u0234 nancial \nassets recognised on its balance sheet but retains either all or a portion of the risks and rewards of the transferred \u0234 nancial assets. In such cases, the \ntransferred \u0234 nancial assets are not derecognised from the balance sheet. \nSuch transactions include repurchase agreements described in Note 2.12. They also include transactions where control over the \u0234 nancial asset is \nretained, for example, by a simultaneous transaction (such as options) with the same counterparty to which the asset is transferred. These are mainly transacted in the \u201cTreasury Markets\u201d segment. In such cases, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement which is the extent to which it is exposed to changes in the value of the transferred asset.Please refer to Note 20 for disclosures on transferred \u0234 nancial assets.2.10  Cash and cash equivalents \nFor the purposes of the cash \u0235 ow statement, cash and cash equivalents \ncomprise cash on hand and non-restricted balances with central banks which are readily convertible into cash.\n2.11   Impairment of \u0234 nancial assets at amortised cost \nand FVOCI\nExpected Credit Losses (ECL)ECL are recognised for all \u0234 nancial assets held at amortised cost, \ndebt instruments measured at FVOCI, guarantees and undrawn credit commitments. It represents the present value of expected cash shortfalls over the residual term of a \u0234 nancial asset, guarantee or \nundrawn commitment. At initial recognition, allowance is required for ECL resulting from possible default events that may occur within the next 12 months (\u201812-month ECL\u2019). In the event of a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk, allowance is required \nfor ECL resulting from possible default events over the expected life of the instrument (\u2018lifetime ECL\u2019). The ECL recognised follows the three-stage model: \u0234 nancial instruments \nwhere 12-month ECL is recognised are considered Stage 1; \u0234 nancial \ninstruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk are in \nStage 2; and \u0234 nancial instruments with objective evidence of default or \ncredit-impaired are in Stage 3. \u2022 Stage 1 \u2013 Financial instruments are classi \u0234 ed as Stage 1 at initial \nrecognition and will remain under Stage 1 unless they experience a signi\u0234 cant increase in credit risk or become credit-impaired. \n12-month ECL is recognised for these instruments. \n\u2022 Stage 2 \u2013 Financial instruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant \nincrease in credit risk (SICR) subsequent to initial recognition, but are not yet credit-impaired, will migrate from Stage 1 to Stage 2.", "start_char_idx": 7037, "end_char_idx": 10974, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a5da4122-1929-4e2f-a6f6-b5e98910be35": {"__data__": {"id_": "a5da4122-1929-4e2f-a6f6-b5e98910be35", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d33b7e0c-4b34-4fb2-b904-5c759c4bee96", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "940c03d0754dd8a82ae5bbc4ff433cd1aae7f41515df621bfb28395c22c8c2b6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "24aa2ce5-c288-4084-83b6-e8965c391489", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "68", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "6a880556beed5a2f8ab0c614f5745fafd78dba191dd67cefe521c33e434ff114", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2c95e9c-3531-42d0-8f8d-f8356e28adcb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f94f3ef2b578940879329e1172a86688f27bcbba92a1fdf8bf13a592388f5d9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "c9cc7d9fb6dbb9c947c33f9fd3bf93c6d34707450ca6c1bc37474bb0093db132", "text": "The ECL recognised follows the three-stage model: \u0234 nancial instruments \nwhere 12-month ECL is recognised are considered Stage 1; \u0234 nancial \ninstruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant increase in credit risk are in \nStage 2; and \u0234 nancial instruments with objective evidence of default or \ncredit-impaired are in Stage 3. \u2022 Stage 1 \u2013 Financial instruments are classi \u0234 ed as Stage 1 at initial \nrecognition and will remain under Stage 1 unless they experience a signi\u0234 cant increase in credit risk or become credit-impaired. \n12-month ECL is recognised for these instruments. \n\u2022 Stage 2 \u2013 Financial instruments which experience a signi \u0234 cant \nincrease in credit risk (SICR) subsequent to initial recognition, but are not yet credit-impaired, will migrate from Stage 1 to Stage 2.

Please refer to Risk Management section for the de \u0234 nition \nofbnon-performing assets.\nLifetime ECL is recognised for these assets. ECL for Stage 3 assets are also known as speci \u0234 c allowances.\nA Stage 3 exposure that is restructured can be upgraded to Stage 2 if there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the obligor is able to service future principal and interest payments in accordance with the restructured terms. Stage 3 \u0234 nancial assets are written-o \u038d , in \nwhole or in part, when the Group has exhausted all practical recovery e\u038d orts and has concluded that there is no reasonable expectation of \nfuture recoveries.\nMeasurement of ECLECL are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. The ECL associated with a \u0234 nancial \ninstrument is typically a product of its probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD) discounted using the original e\u038d ective interest rate to the reporting date. \nComponent Description\nPD Point-in-time (based on current conditions, adjusted to \ntake into account estimates of future conditions that will impact PD) estimate of the likelihood of default. \nLGD Estimate of the loss arising on default. It is based on the di\u038d erence between the contractual cash \u0235 ows due and \nthose that the Group would expect to receive, including recoveries from collaterals.\nEAD Estimate of the expected credit exposure at time of default, taking into account repayments of principal and interest as well as expected drawdowns on undrawn credit commitments and potential pay-outs on guarantees issued. \nThe 12-month ECL is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD, LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated using the lifetime PD. The 12-month and lifetime PDs represent the probability of default occurring over the next 12 months and the remaining maturity of the instrument respectively.In most instances, expected remaining maturity is the same as the remaining contractual life which represents the maximum contractual period over which the Group is exposed to the credit risk of the borrower. However, for some revolving products (e.g. credit cards), the expected remaining maturity may exceed the contractual maturity. In such instances, behavioural expected remaining life will be used.ECL Modelling - Point-in-Time and Forward-Looking Adjustments The Group leverages the models and parameters implemented under the Basel II Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) framework where possible, with appropriate modi \u0234 cations to meet SFRS(I) 9 requirements. \nOther relevant historical information, loss experience or proxies will be utilised for portfolios without appropriate Basel models and parameters, with a view to maximise the use of available information that is reliable and supportable.For the wholesale portfolios, credit cycle indices (CCIs) have been developed for the key industries and geographies. CCIs are summary measures that depict broad-based, sector-wide changes in credit risk, which are constructed by comparing the median expected default frequency of \u0234 rms within each segment against a long-run average. \nExpected default frequency is in turn a market-based point-in-time default risk measure driven by the market value of \u0234 rms\u2019 assets, asset volatility \nand leverage. CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/ parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information. LGDs are determined using historical loss data, which are adjusted for both the latest and forecasted recovery experience. The Group relies on a Monte Carlo simulation approach to consider over 100 probability-weighted forward-looking scenarios in estimating ECL. This involves simulations of many alternative CCI scenarios to arrive at an unbiased ECL estimate that are meant to cover all possible good and bad scenarios based on known estimates. For retail portfolios, historical loss experience is used in conjunction with the forecast loss rates which take into account relevant macroeconomic variables, such as property prices and unemployment rates.Expert credit judgement and post model adjustmentsThe measurement of ECL requires the application of expert credit judgement and post model adjustments.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4655, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "968e0de8-97a2-4163-850f-1cbbf8fc8786": {"__data__": {"id_": "968e0de8-97a2-4163-850f-1cbbf8fc8786", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4be192ae-d59b-4d01-a081-2ca759607eff", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "d48454c12c87ee0994d6ecc84a70e152f609262723bf7081cbc08eb3342130dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d2c95e9c-3531-42d0-8f8d-f8356e28adcb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "69", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "f94f3ef2b578940879329e1172a86688f27bcbba92a1fdf8bf13a592388f5d9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d2c9fe7b-7e2d-4af1-bbc4-f959a8da5bec", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1edd829d18667d6270ccc25a34cc1b2536daca38ac60e57ea64e88c83040ece6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "86ca602f6dc90f0676c20fd94658c92666a0ad2d07f05962f94cb7f8f83ae2a0", "text": "CCIs are then used as inputs to convert the generally more through-the-cycle PDs derived from Basel models/ parameters into the point-in-time equivalents by adding the unaccounted portion of cyclical variations, as well as to incorporate forward-looking information.

Such top-down additional modelled ECL was quanti\u0234 ed by means of applying conditional probabilities on more \nsevere scenarios materialising from emerging risk themes. \nThe Group has two thematic overlays as at 31 December 2022.In addition to the base scenarios generated by the model, the Group has incorporated a stress scenario and assigned probabilities to the scenarios, in line with management\u2019s judgement of the likelihood of each scenario. The stress scenario envisages persistence of the Russia-Ukraine con\u0235  ict, as well as a sharp, broad-based global recession with a \nspike in risk aversion in \u0234 nancial markets and large capital out \u0235 ows from \nemerging economies. b\nThe other thematic overlay is to address pricing pressures and risks of asset stranding that the conventional energy sector could face as a result of a transition to a low-carbon economy. Probabilities were assigned to the scenarios in-line with management\u2019s judgement of the likelihood of each scenario.132 A Di\u038d  erent Kind of Bank  DBS Annual Report 2022Governance frameworkThe measurement of ECL is subject to a robust governance framework as described below.\u2022 The Group ECL Review Committee (Review Committee) is the overarching committee for ECL related matters and comprises senior management and representatives from functions across the Group.

The Operating Committee recommends changes to ECL models, methodologies and thematic overlays to the Review Committee; provides oversight over system design, infrastructure and development; and establishes principles and signi\u0234  cant policies pertaining to ECL. Group Credit Risk \nModels Committee oversees ECL models and credit risk models used by the Group. \n\u2022 Location ECL committees are established for key overseas subsidiaries to govern and manage location-speci \u0234 c ECL reporting. \n\u2022 ECL models are subject to independent validation by the Risk Management Group (RMG) Model Validation team, as well as independent reviews by internal and external auditors. The validation and assurance processes cover the review of the underlying ECL methodology including its logic and conceptual soundness.\nMinimum Regulatory Loss AllowanceSingapore banks are required to maintain the Minimum Regulatory Loss Allowances (MRLA) of at least 1% of the gross carrying amount of selected credit exposures net of collaterals per MAS Notice 612.

Goodwill is stated at cost less impairment losses and is tested at least annually for impairment. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units (CGU) or group of CGUs expected to bene \u0234 t from \nthe combination\u2019s synergies. An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a CGU, or group of CGUs, including the goodwill, exceeds the applicable recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of a CGU or CGU group is the higher of the CGU\u2019s or CGU group\u2019s fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in the income statement and cannot be reversed in subsequent periods. \n2.14  Properties and other \u0234 xed assets \nOwned properties and other \u0234 xed assets\nProperties (including investment properties) and other \u0234 xed assets are \nstated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to write down the costs of the assets to their estimated residual values over the estimated useful lives of the assets. No depreciation is recognised when the residual value is higher than the carrying amount.Generally, the useful lives are as follows:Leasehold land  100 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter. Leasehold land where the unexpired lease period is more than 100 years is not depreciated.\nBuildings  30 to 50 years or over the remaining lease period, whichever is shorter.\nComputer software 3 to 5 yearsO\u025d  ce equipment,  5 to 10 years\nfurniture and \u0234 ttings\nLeasehold improvements Up to 20 yearsLeased properties and other \u0234 xed assets\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term at the lease commencement date.

The Group applies hedge accounting for economic hedge relationships that meet the hedge accounting criteria. To qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of each hedging relationship, the Group designates and documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item; the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge transaction; and the methods used to assess the e \u038d ectiveness of the \nhedge. At inception and on an on-going basis, the Group also assesses and measures the e \u038d ectiveness of the hedging relationship between the \nhedging instrument and the hedged item. Where all relevant criteria are met, hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between hedging instrument and the hedged item.

The details of the Plans are described in Note 40.Equity instruments granted and ultimately vested under the Plans are recognised in the income statement based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the date of grant. The expense is amortised over the vesting period of each award, with a corresponding adjustment to the share plan reserves. A trust has been set up for the DBSH Employee Share Purchase Plan. The employer\u2019s share of the trust fund is consolidated. The unvested DBSH shares held by the trust funds are accounted for as treasury shares, which is presented as a deduction within equity.135 Financial statements", "start_char_idx": 7512, "end_char_idx": 11999, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f069f9f0-efd1-4ea9-8769-e9aa322b8aa6": {"__data__": {"id_": "f069f9f0-efd1-4ea9-8769-e9aa322b8aa6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8b8b6b8-8582-4a24-8fc3-51dddd902324", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "8119f2eafa393dfbe5ca04c99f73e4032e9a25f45355ca526018ddb3603fb913", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5f2fd9b4-fe80-4fc3-82f3-c8182ae8d06d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "458bc90f09a8695e14813d608b5b44def51787bbe686675ef1c10bbf9295dc32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9642d1e4-14cd-4052-ba18-4ba6b31bc543", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "88f187fb8f420e14c8612e35e6a658b87ee2613521f7231d16f0d59a8fd0e62a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "aa57eaef90c5c0424f18f7d516ef5317ea5d05b6a8fb4c543b835cd6b00fb073", "text": "2.22   Current and deferred taxes\nCurrent income tax for current and prior periods is recognised as the amount expected to be paid or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The Group considers uncertain tax positions generally at the level of the total tax liability to each tax authority for each period. The liability is determined based on the total amount of current tax expected to be paid, taking into account all tax uncertainties, using either an expected value approach or a single best estimate of the most likely outcome. Tax assets and liabilities of the same type (current or deferred) are o\u038d set when a legal right of o \u038d set exists and settlement in this manner \nis intended. This applies generally when they arise from the same tax reporting group and relate to the same tax authority.Deferred income tax is provided on temporary di \u038d erences arising \nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. The amount of deferred tax \nprovided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. The amount of deferred tax assets recognised takes into account the likelihood the amount that can be used to o \u038d set payable taxes on \nfuture pro \u0234 ts. \nDeferred tax related to fair value re-measurement of FVOCI investments, which are recognised outside pro \u0234 t or loss, is also \nrecognised outside pro \u0234 t or loss, i.e. in other comprehensive income \nand accumulated in the FVOCI revaluation reserves. \n3.   Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe Group\u2019s accounting policies and use of estimates are integral to the reported amounts in the \u0234 nancial statements. Certain accounting \nestimates require management\u2019s judgement in determining the appropriate methodology for valuation of assets and liabilities. Procedures are in place to ensure that methodologies are reviewed and revised as appropriate. The Group believes its estimates for determining the valuation of its assets and liabilities are appropriate.The following is a brief description of the Group\u2019s critical accounting estimates that involve management\u2019s valuation judgement.\n3.1   Impairment of \u0234 nancial assets \nIt is the Group\u2019s policy to recognise, through charges against pro \u0234 t, \nallowances in respect of estimated and inherent credit losses in its portfolio as described in Note 2.11.ECLs are unbiased and probability-weighted estimates of credit losses determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, considering past events, current conditions and assessments of future economic conditions at the reporting date. This will necessarily involve the use of judgement.Please refer to Risk Management section for a further description of the Group\u2019s credit risk management framework, policies and procedures. \n3.2  Fair value of \u0234 nancial instruments \nThe majority of the Group\u2019s \u0234 nancial instruments reported at fair value \nare based on quoted and observable market prices or on internally developed models that are based on independently sourced or veri \u0234 ed \nmarket parameters.The fair value of \u0234 nancial instruments without an observable market \nprice in an active market may be determined using valuation models. The choice of model requires signi \u0234 cant judgement for complex \nproducts especially those in the \u201cTreasury Markets\u201d segment.Policies and procedures have been established to facilitate the exercise of judgement in determining the risk characteristics of various \u0234 nancial \ninstruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash \u0235 ows and other \nfactors used in the valuation process. Please refer to Note 42 for further details on fair valuation and fair value hierarchy of the Group\u2019s \u0234 nancial instruments measured at fair value.\n3.3  Goodwill impairment\nThe Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU. Note 28 provides details of goodwill atbthe reporting date. \nThe recoverable amount represents the present value of the estimated future cash \u0235 ows expected to arise from continuing operations. Therefore, \nin arriving at the recoverable amount, management exercises judgement in estimating the future cash \u0235 ows, growth rate and discount rate. \n3.4  Income taxes\nThe Group has exposure to income taxes in several jurisdictions. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on reasonable estimate of whether additional tax will be due. Where uncertainty exists around the Group\u2019s tax position, appropriate provisions are provided based on the technical assessment of the cases.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4808, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9642d1e4-14cd-4052-ba18-4ba6b31bc543": {"__data__": {"id_": "9642d1e4-14cd-4052-ba18-4ba6b31bc543", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a8b8b6b8-8582-4a24-8fc3-51dddd902324", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "8119f2eafa393dfbe5ca04c99f73e4032e9a25f45355ca526018ddb3603fb913", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f069f9f0-efd1-4ea9-8769-e9aa322b8aa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "71", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "aa57eaef90c5c0424f18f7d516ef5317ea5d05b6a8fb4c543b835cd6b00fb073", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9496f2a0-fade-4cd3-ba3a-04b9dc07e8fe", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7b8ceb34d68b83c874321f781c49c0c7e9d22ec8b22b788ca15c8b3ac8601dde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "88f187fb8f420e14c8612e35e6a658b87ee2613521f7231d16f0d59a8fd0e62a", "text": "3.3  Goodwill impairment\nThe Group performs an impairment review to ensure that the carrying amount of a CGU to which goodwill is allocated does not exceed the recoverable amount of the CGU.

not o \u038d set on the balance sheet \nThe Group enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties where it is appropriate and feasible to do so to mitigate  counterparty risk. \nThe credit risk associated with favourable contracts is reduced by a master netting arrangement to the extent that if an event of default occurs, all \namounts with the counterparty are settled on a net basis. Master netting arrangements do not result in an o \u038d set of \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities on \nthe balance sheet, as the legal right to o \u038d set the transactions is conditional upon default.\nThese agreements include derivative master agreements (including the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) Mas ter Agreement), \nglobal master repurchase agreements and global securities lending agreements. The collaterals received and pledged under these agreements \nare generally conducted under terms that are in accordance with normal market practice. The agreements may allow rehypothecatio n of collateral \nreceived and there may be ongoing margin requirements to mitigate counterparty risk.The disclosures set out in the tables below pertain to \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities that are not o \u038d set in the Group\u2019s balance sheet but are subject to \nmaster netting arrangements or similar agreements that cover similar \u0234 nancial instruments.

Financial Assets Pledged or Transferred\nThe Group pledges or transfers \u0234 nancial assets to third parties in the ordinary course of business. Transferred assets continue to be recognised in the \nGroup\u2019s \u0234 nancial statements when the Group retains substantially all their risks and rewards. Among these, as set out below, are securi ties pledged or \ntransferred pursuant to repurchase or securities lending or collateral swap agreements and for derivative transactions under cr edit support agreements. \nThere were no derecognised assets that were subject to the Group\u2019s partial continuing involvement as at 31 December 2022 and 31  December 2021. \nSecurities and Certi \u0234 cates of deposit\nSecurities transferred under repurchase, securities lending and collateral swap arrangements are generally conducted under term s in line with \nnormal market practice. The counterparty is typically allowed to sell or re-pledge the securities but has an obligation to retu rn them at maturity. \nIfbthebsecurities decrease in value, the Group may, in certain circumstances, be required to place additional collateral. \nFor repurchase agreements, the securities pledged or transferred continue to be recorded on the balance sheet while cash received in exchange isbrecorded as a \u0234 nancial liability. The Group also pledges assets to secure its short position in securities and to facilitate settlement opera tions. \nThebfair value of the associated liabilities approximates their carrying amount of $9,020 million (2021: $4,488 million), which are  recorded under \n\u201cDuebtobbanks\u201d, \u201cDeposits and balances from customers\u201d and \u201cOther liabilities\u201d on the balance sheet. \nFor securities lending and collateral swap transactions, the securities lent continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the Group mainly receives other \u0234 nancial assets in exchange, the associated liabilities are not recorded on the balance sheet.\nIn addition, the Group also pledges securities for derivative transactions under credit support agreements. These assets continue to be recorded on the balance sheet. As the related derivative assets and liabilities are managed on a portfolio basis, there is no direct relationship between the securities pledged and the associated liabilities. As such, the associated liabilities are not disclosed. \nCovered bonds\nPursuant to the Bank\u2019s Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to \na bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte Ltd (see Notes 23.2 and 31.4). bThese residential mortgages continue to be \nrecognised on the Bank\u2019s balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them.As at 31 December 2022, the carrying value of the covered bonds in issue was $7,575 million (2021: $5,689 million), while the c arrying value of \nassets assigned was $16,740 million (2021: $9,237 million). bThe di\u038d  erence in values is attributable to an intended over-collateralisation required \ntobmaintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3978, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "98bf5ffb-0090-40d4-9f2a-b6d67f120c3d": {"__data__": {"id_": "98bf5ffb-0090-40d4-9f2a-b6d67f120c3d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d6cc2eb5-0954-433b-b99a-991110ffd6b0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "57830a551b8398d8078acfdb4c455cd4bf52cee11900d4ec3b5fca0f597599d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb263dab-31ef-4e62-ad7b-c529acff0711", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "509db71caed256bd76c5f80c70f26b0a085611c2d1fe37436435149e24b0d37a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f5937d93-1e1a-482f-ac56-6b5fc77d8e07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "366373eb5467f78f923c7ebd4deb6c951e1a5df7905ef8e3c9aae614cc89f521", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "49339af4ac3f5dff85917dd7b7a0ac6931ae9ad930efaad55215eb43a40bac3d", "text": "Covered bonds\nPursuant to the Bank\u2019s Global Covered Bond Programme, selected pools of residential mortgages originated by the Bank have been assigned to \na bankruptcy-remote structured entity, Bayfront Covered Bonds Pte Ltd (see Notes 23.2 and 31.4). bThese residential mortgages continue to be \nrecognised on the Bank\u2019s balance sheet as the Bank remains exposed to the risks and rewards associated with them.As at 31 December 2022, the carrying value of the covered bonds in issue was $7,575 million (2021: $5,689 million), while the c arrying value of \nassets assigned was $16,740 million (2021: $9,237 million). bThe di\u038d  erence in values is attributable to an intended over-collateralisation required \ntobmaintain the credit ratings of the covered bonds in issue, and additional assets assigned to facilitate future issuances.

The more material goodwill at the Group relates to DBS Bank (Hong Kong) Limited\u2019s franchise. The recoverable value of the franc hise is determined \nbased on a value-in-use calculation. The CGU\u2019s \u0234 ve-year projected free cash \u0235 ows, after taking into account the maintenance of capital adequacy \nrequirements at target levels, are discounted by its cost of capital to derive its present value. To derive the value beyond th e \u0234 fth year, a long-term \ngrowth rate is imputed to the \u0234 fth-year cash \u0235 ow and then discounted by the cost of capital to derive the terminal value. The long-term growth rate \nused does not exceed the historical long-term growth rate of the market the CGU operates in. The recoverable value is the sum o f the present value \nof the \u0234 ve-year cash \u0235 ows and the terminal value. \nA growth rate of 3.5% (2021: 3.5%) and discount rate of 9.0% (2021: 9.0%) were assumed in the value-in-use calculation for DBS Bank (Hong Kong) \nLimited\u2019s franchise. The process of evaluating goodwill impairment involves management judgement and prudent estimates of various factors including future cash \n\u0235 ows as well as the cost of capital and long-term growth rates. The results can be highly sensitive to the assumptions used. Ke y assumptions used \nto determine the recoverable amounts of the CGU, including growth rate and discount rate, are tested for sensitivity by applyin g a reasonably \npossible change to those assumptions.

Financial Derivatives\n37.1  Trading derivatives\nMost of the Group\u2019s derivatives relate to sales and trading activities. Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of derivatives to customers \nto enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities are entered into principally f or dealer\u2019s margin or for \nthe purpose of generating a pro \u0234 t from short-term \u0235 uctuations in price. \nTrading includes mainly market-making and warehousing to facilitate customer orders. Market-making involves quoting bid and o \u038d er prices to other \nmarket participants with the intention of generating revenues based on spread and volume. Warehousing involves holding on to po sitions in order \nto liquidate in an orderly fashion with timing of unwinding determined by market conditions and traders\u2019 views of markets as th ey evolve. 160 A Di\u038d  erent Kind of Bank  DBS Annual Report 202237.2  Hedging derivatives\nThe accounting treatment of hedging derivatives varies according to the nature of the hedge and whether the hedge meets the spe ci\u0234 ed criteria to \nqualify for hedge accounting.

Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\nIn March 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced the dates on which LIBOR would be discontinued. All GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY London Interbank O \u038d ered Rate (LIBOR) settings and the one-week \nand two-month USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 31 December 2021. The remaining USD LIBOR settings would lose representativeness or discontinue after 30 June 2023. In Singapore, as announced by the Steering Committee for SOR & SIBOR Transition to SORA (SC-STS) on 31 March 2021, Singapore Swap O\u038d  er Rate (SOR), which relies on USD LIBOR in its computation, \nwould similarly be discontinued immediately after 30 June 2023 across all settings. The Singapore Interbank O \u038d ered Rate (SIBOR) would \ndiscontinue by end-2024, with 6-month SIBOR being discontinued immediately after 31 March 2022.The Group\u2019s main interest rate benchmark exposures are USD LIBOR, SOR and SIBOR. USD LIBOR will be replaced by USD Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) while the replacement benchmark rate for SOR and SIBOR is Singapore Overnight Rate Average (SORA). Changes in contractual cash \u0235 ows of \u0234 nancial instruments\nDuring the year, the Group continued to apply the practical expedients provided in SFRS(I) 9. These expedients require changes in the contractual cash \u0235 ows of \u0234 nancial instruments that result solely from \nIBOR reform and are economically equivalent to be accounted for by updating the e \u038d ective interest rate, rather than recognising an \nimmediate gain or loss in the income statement. Hedge accountingDuring the year, the Group continued to apply SFRS (I) 9\u2019s hedge accounting reliefs relating to Interest Rate Benchmark Reform. The key assumption made when performing hedge accounting is that both the hedged item and hedging instrument will be amended from existing IBORs to new Alternative Reference Rates (ARRs) at the same time. Where actual di \u038d erences between those dates arise, hedge \nine\u038d ectiveness will be recorded in the income statement. \nHow the Group is managing the transition to ARRsA Group steering committee was established in 2019 to manage the impact of IBOR reform on the Group. The committee comprises senior representatives from Institutional Banking Group, Consumer Banking Group, Treasury Markets, Finance, Risk Management Group, Technology & Operations, Legal and Compliance and Group Strategic Marketing and Communications and is chaired by the Corporate Treasurer. The Terms of Reference of the committee are to review transition plans related to LIBOR and SOR discontinuation, SIBOR reform and other interest rate benchmark reform, to assess the Group\u2019s key risks across di\u038d erent scenarios, and to develop strategies to manage existing and \nnew business in the context of these risks. Oversight of IBOR reform is provided by the Group Executive Committee and the Board Risk Management Committee. As at 31 December 2022, changes required to systems, processes and models have been identi \u0234 ed and have been substantially implemented. \nAll contracts with interest rates that are pegged to GBP, CHF, EUR, JPY LIBOR or one-week and two-month tenors for USD LIBOR have been remediated. For contracts referencing SOR, SIBOR or the remaining USD LIBOR settings, the Group has begun its communication with relevant counterparties and contract remediation is ongoing. The Group has identi \u0234 ed that the risks arising from IBOR reform are:\n\u2022 Risk of contractual disputes arising from the lack of legal clauses catering for the discontinuation of an interest rate benchmark, and its replacement with an ARR, or such clauses failing to operate as expected; and\n\u2022 Risk of reputational harm due to poor customer management related to interest rate benchmark discontinuation, leading to loss ofbcustomer business.\nThese risks are mitigated through robust oversight by the Group steering committee.

Hedge Accounting\nThe Group enters into hedging transactions to manage exposures to interest rate and foreign currency risks. Hedge accounting is  applied to \nminimise volatility in earnings arising from changes in interest rate and foreign exchange rates. Please refer to Risk Management section for more information on market risk and the Group\u2019s risk management practices and Note 2.19 for the \nGroup\u2019s accounting policy for hedge accounting. \n39.1  Fair value hedge\nIn accordance with the risk management strategy in place, the Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the following: \u2022 issued \u0234 xed rate debt;\n\u2022 \u0234 xed rate bonds; and\n\u2022 exposures to corporate loans.\nIn such instances, the Group hedges the benchmark interest rate risk component which is an observable and reliably measurable c omponent of \ninterest rate risk. Speci \u0234 cally, the Group has designated fair value hedge relationships, on a hedge-by-hedge basis, to hedge against movements in \nthe benchmark interest rate. This e \u038d ectively results in the recognition of interest expense (for \u0234 xed rate liabilities), or interest income (for \u0234 xed rate \nassets) at \u0235 oating rates. The Group also uses cross currency swaps when there is a need to hedge both interest rate and foreign exchange r isks.\nFor risks not covered by hedge accounting, the Group manages these in accordance with its risk management strategy. The Group assesses prospective hedge e \u038d ectiveness by comparing the changes in fair value of the hedged item resulting from movements in the \nbenchmark interest rate with the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps used to hedge the exposure.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n42.1  Valuation Process\nThe valuation processes within the Group are governed by the Valuation Policy, which is approved by the Board Audit Committee. The Valuation Policy applies to all \u0234 nancial assets and liabilities that are \nmeasured at fair value, covering both market prices as well as model inputs.

The IPV process entails independent \nchecks to compare traders\u2019 marks to independent sources such as broker/ dealer quotes or market consensus providers. Where market parameters are sourced independently for the marking ofb\u0234 nancial assets and liabilities, or used as inputs into a valuation \nmodel, these are checked for reliability and accuracy, for example by reviewing large daily movements or by referencing other similar sources, or transactions.Valuation adjustments and reserves are taken to account for close-out costs, model and market parameter uncertainty, and any other factor that may a \u038d ect valuations. Valuation adjustment and reserve \nmethodologies are approved by the GMLRC and governed by the Valuation Policy. The valuation adjustments and reserves include but are not limited to:Model and Parameter Uncertainty AdjustmentsValuation uncertainties may occur during fair value measurement either due to uncertainties in the required input parameters or uncertainties in the modelling methods used in the valuation process. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to take these factors into account.For example, where market data such as prices or rates for an instrument are no longer observable after an extended period of time, these inputs used to value the \u0234 nancial instruments may no longer be \nrelevant in the current market conditions. In such situations, adjustments may be necessary to address the pricing uncertainty arising from the use of stale market data inputs. Credit Valuation AdjustmentsCredit valuation adjustments are taken to re \u0235 ect the impact on fair value \nof counterparty credit risk. Credit valuation adjustments are based upon the creditworthiness of the counterparties, magnitude of the current or potential exposure on the underlying transactions, netting and collateral arrangements, and the maturity of the underlying transactions.Funding Valuation AdjustmentsFunding valuation adjustments represent an estimate of the adjustment to fair value that a market participant would make in incorporating funding costs and bene \u0234 ts that arise in relation to uncollateralised \nderivatives positions.Day 1 Pro \u0234 t or Loss (P&L) Reserve\nIn situations where the market for an instrument is not active and its fair value is established using a valuation model based on signi \u0234 cant \nunobservable market parameters, the Day 1 P&L arising from the di\u038d erence in transacted price and end-of-day model valuation is set \naside as reserves. A market parameter is de \u0234 ned as being signi \u0234 cant \nwhen its impact on the Day 1 P&L is greater than an internally determined threshold. The Day 1 P&L reserve is released to the income statement when the parameters become observable or when the transaction is closed out or amortised over the duration of the transaction. At year end, the unamortised Day 1 P&L was not material.Bid-O\u038d er Adjustments\nThe Group often holds, at varying points in time, both long or shortb positions in \u0234 nancial instruments which are valued using mid-\nmarket levels. Bid-o \u038d er adjustments are then made to account for \nclose-out costs.\n42.2  Fair Value Hierarchy\nThe fair value hierarchy accords the highest level to observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest level to unobservable inputs. The fair value measurement of each \u0234 nancial instrument is categorised in \naccordance with the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the input with the lowest level that is signi \u0234 cant to the entire measurement.

These \nwould include government and sovereign securities, listed equities and corporate debt securities which are actively traded. Derivatives contracts which are traded in an active exchange market are also classi\u0234 ed as Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nWhere fair value is determined using quoted market prices in less active markets or quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, such instruments are generally classi \u0234 ed as Level 2. In cases where quoted \nprices are generally not available, the Group will determine the fair value based on valuation techniques that use market parameters as inputs including but not limited to yield curves, volatilities and foreign exchange rates. The majority of valuation techniques employ only observable market data so that reliability of the fair value measurement is high. These would include corporate debt securities, repurchase, reverse repurchase agreements and most of the Group\u2019s over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. The Group classi \u0234 es \u0234 nancial instruments as Level 3 when there is \nreliance on unobservable market parameters whether used directly to value a \u0234 nancial asset or liability, or used as inputs to a valuation model, \nattributing to a signi \u0234 cant contribution to the instrument value. These \nwould include all input parameters which are derived from historical data, for example, asset correlations or certain volatilities. Level 3 instruments also include unquoted equity securities which are measured based on the net asset value of the investments. In addition, Level 3 inputs include all stale quoted security prices and other approximations (e.g. bonds valued using credit default swap spreads). 169 Financial statements", "start_char_idx": 7169, "end_char_idx": 9631, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "641065d4-0198-42da-8edb-d9feeac2f826": {"__data__": {"id_": "641065d4-0198-42da-8edb-d9feeac2f826", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2dbb4e0-a2f2-4126-8d82-fc28e86ba545", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "88", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "ed8dc5e53f96e70565d172161e42deb9e8c0126bd5aa774ed9f540f61371f13d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "64157ad6-f863-4372-af4c-b0944a981c34", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "1062475d2da5c36a2da8dff7f33e606e0cbce43bdb262758486218b0c40aae44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c772b60-82ad-4f47-b410-60422c0a765c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "89c3950dd3bb9464e7337ace783bce15c12b1dd5349676e3f914010cd12a5a15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "bba9fba6b935396863e724da609c2765b021248eada911ab323594ed6ed83873", "text": "The following tables present assets and liabilities measured at fair value, classi \u0234 ed by level within the fair value hierarchy. \nThe bank and corporate securities classi \u0234 ed as Level 3 at 31 December 2022 comprised mainly securities which were marked using approximations, \nless liquid bonds and unquoted equity securities valued based on net asset value of the investments.

Credit Risk\n43.1  Maximum exposure to credit risk\nThe following table shows the exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and o \u038d -balance sheet \u0234 nancial instruments, before taking into account \nany collateral held, other credit enhancements and netting arrangements. For on-balance sheet \u0234 nancial assets, the maximum credit exposure is \nthe carrying amounts. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the amount the Group would have to pay  if the instrument \nisbcalled upon. For undrawn facilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.\nThe Group\u2019s exposures to credit risk, measured using the expected gross credit exposures that will arise upon a default of the end obligor are \nas shown in the Group\u2019s Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). These exposures, which include both on-balance sheet and o \u038d -balance sheet \u0234 nancial \ninstruments, are shown without taking into account any collateral held or netting arrangements. Analysis of CollateralWhilst the Group\u2019s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of o \u038d -balance sheet instruments, the \namount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to o \u038d setting collateral, credit guarantees and other \nactions taken to mitigate the Group\u2019s exposure.The description of collateral for each class of \u0234 nancial asset is set out below.\nBalances with central banks, Government securities and treasury bills, Due from banks and Bank and corporate debt securitiesCollateral is generally not sought for these assets. DerivativesThe Group maintains collateral agreements and enters into master netting agreements with most of the counterparties for derivat ive transactions. \nPlease refer to Note 37 for the impact of netting arrangements recognised for the computation of Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR).Loans and advances to customers, Contingent liabilities and commitmentsCertain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial e xtent. In particular, \nresidential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties. Income-producing real estate, which is a sub-set of the \nSpecialised Lending exposure, is fully secured by the underlying assets \u0234 nanced. \nThe extent to which credit exposures are covered by Basel eligible collateral, besides real estate, after the application of th e requisite regulatory \nhaircuts, is shown in the Group\u2019s Pillar 3 Disclosures (unaudited). The amounts are a sub-set of the actual collateral arrangem ents entered by the \nGroup as Basel imposes strict legal and operational standards before collateral can be admitted as credit risk mitigants.

The \u0234 nancial e \u038d ects of the purchase or \nacquisition of such Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the proposed Share Purchase Mandate on the \u0234 nancial \nstatements of the Group and the Company for the \u0234 nancial year ended 31 December \n2022 based on these and other assumptions are set out in paragraph 2.7 of the Letter to Shareholders dated 9 March 2023 (the \u201cLetter\u201d).Please refer to the Letter for further details.\n213 Notice of Annual General Meeting", "start_char_idx": 7757, "end_char_idx": 10579, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d55c5119-8946-49a9-9ef5-c92a83fb659e": {"__data__": {"id_": "d55c5119-8946-49a9-9ef5-c92a83fb659e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a1b47fc0-3a0f-4fd2-ba38-0ce64e177290", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "110", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "a030b2db437735933363b2e0fb2233a63ee51ef6303403ccc3fa91037636513e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e9133d3-352d-46a2-b60f-533b830fab76", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_path": "data/dbs-annual-report-2022.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5122566, "creation_date": "2024-01-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-01-11", "last_accessed_date": "2024-01-11"}, "hash": "1a10d1cc95b72a3857d0aeccf4a9d438094686ca2e82cd426d5c5d2a401c7528", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "58288476-bac1-4625-92f8-fa4be10dc97e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da22c794051db1684a75248aa5a49e8e307cdbd3bcc406d0fa2f57903733bf6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "b252701755dab9a56d38457a504bb3d944f1f53cc72308408d2f37b1d8f1ea14", "text": "Name of Director Peter Seah Lim Huat\nDate of appointment 16 November 2009\nDate of last re-appointment (if applicable) 30 April 2020\nAge 76\nCountry of principal residence Singapore\nThe Board\u2019s comments on this appointment (including rationale, selection criteria, board diversity considerations, and the search and nomination process)Mr Seah is considered non-independent as he has served as a Director for more than nine years as at 16 November 2018.
